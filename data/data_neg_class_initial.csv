An old team at reddit,132258,3cucye,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/,20409,1436562890.0,"Ellen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement.  I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.
 
We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.
 
We’re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of “cofounder”.
 
A few other points.  Mods, you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.
 
Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.

Third, as a redditor, I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.
 
As a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.

If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.
 
 
[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.

Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.
 
[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate—he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.


NOTE: I am going to let the reddit team answer questions here, and go do an AMA myself now.

An Open Letter to the Reddit Community,115842,5r43td,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/5r43td/an_open_letter_to_the_reddit_community/,31034,1485815689.0,"After two weeks abroad, I was looking forward to returning to the U.S. this weekend, but as I got off the plane at LAX on Sunday, I wasn't sure what country I was coming back to.

President Trump’s recent executive order is not only potentially unconstitutional, but deeply un-American. We are a nation of immigrants, after all. In the tech world, we often talk about a startup’s “unfair advantage” that allows it to beat competitors. Welcoming immigrants and refugees has been our country's unfair advantage, and coming from an immigrant family has been mine as an entrepreneur.

As many of you know, I am the son of an undocumented immigrant from Germany and the great grandson of refugees who fled the Armenian Genocide.

A little over a century ago, a Turkish soldier decided my great grandfather was too young to kill after cutting down his parents in front of him; instead of turning the sword on the boy, the soldier sent him to an orphanage. Many Armenians, including my great grandmother, found sanctuary in Aleppo, Syria—before the two reconnected and found their way to Ellis Island. Thankfully they weren't retained, rather they found this message:

*“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”*

My great grandfather didn’t speak much English, but he worked hard, and was able to get a job at Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company in Binghamton, NY. That was his family's golden door. And though he and my great grandmother had four children, all born in the U.S., immigration continued to reshape their family, generation after generation. The one son they had—my grandfather [(here’s his AMA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29039l/iam_john_ohanian_92_year_old_lawyer_parttime/)—volunteered to serve in the Second World War and married a French-Armenian immigrant. And my mother, a native of Hamburg, Germany, decided to leave her friends, family, and education behind after falling in love with my father, who was born in San Francisco.

She got a student visa, came to the U.S. and then worked as an au pair, uprooting her entire life for love in a foreign land. She overstayed her visa. She should have left, but she didn't. After she and my father married, she received a green card, which she kept for over a decade until she became a citizen. I grew up speaking German, but she insisted I focus on my English in order to be successful. She eventually got her citizenship and I’ll never forget her swearing in ceremony.

If you’ve never seen people taking the pledge of allegiance for the first time as U.S. Citizens, it will move you: a room full of people who can really appreciate what I was lucky enough to grow up with, simply by being born in Brooklyn. It thrills me to write reference letters for enterprising founders who are looking to get visas to start their companies here, to create value and jobs for these United States.

My forebears were brave refugees who found a home in this country. I’ve always been proud to live in a country that said yes to these shell-shocked immigrants from a strange land, that created a path for a woman who wanted only to work hard and start a family here. 

Without them, there’s no me, and there’s no Reddit. We are Americans. Let’s not forget that we’ve thrived as a nation because we’ve been a beacon for the courageous—the tired, the poor, the tempest-tossed.

Right now, Lady Liberty’s lamp is dimming, which is why it's more important than ever that we speak out and show up to support all those for whom it shines—past, present, and future. I ask you to do this however you see fit, whether it's calling your representative (this works, it's how we defeated SOPA + PIPA), marching in protest, [donating to the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu), or voting, of course, and not just for Presidential elections.

Our platform, like our country, thrives the more people and communities we have within it. Reddit, Inc. will continue to welcome all citizens of the world to our digital community and our office.

—Alexis

The letter acknowledges that AI might one day help eradicate disease and poverty, but it also puts the onus on scientists at the forefront of this technology to keep the human factor front and center of their innovations. I'm part of a campaign enabled by Nokia and hope you will join the conversation on http://www.wired.com/maketechhuman. Learn more about my foundation here: http://stephenhawkingfoundation.org/ 
 

Due to the fact that I will be answering questions at my own pace, working with the moderators of /r/Science we are opening this thread up in advance to gather your questions. 
 

My goal will be to answer as many of the questions you submit as possible over the coming weeks. I appreciate all of your understanding, and taking the time to ask me your questions.


**Moderator Note**

This AMA will be run differently due to the constraints of Professor Hawking.  The AMA will be in two parts, today we with gather questions.  Please post your questions and vote on your favorite questions, from these questions Professor Hawking will select which ones he feels he can give answers to.  

Once the answers have been written, we, the mods, will cut and paste the answers into this AMA and post a link to the AMA in /r/science so that people can re-visit the AMA and read his answers in the proper context.  The date for this is undecided, as it depends on several factors.  

Professor Hawking is a guest of /r/science and has volunteered to answer questions; please treat him with due respect. **Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.**

"We need to make it clear to the FCC that we want uncapped Internet access, for innovation in an increasingly data dependent world and user protection.",71431,5749a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5749a8/we_need_to_make_it_clear_to_the_fcc_that_we_want/,2459,1476281600.0,"Comcast's data cap policy is a flawed consumer control measure against those who would go without cable and a direct action against companies that have actually innovated over the past decade rather than sit pretty on a monopoly. 

**Why this is flawed:**


**There is no guarantee of accuracy or transparency:**

Regardless of your stance on the matter there should be no argument that internet usage amounts should be accurate and transparent to users affected by it. However that is not the case at all, there is no third party government agency in charge of regulating broadband metering. Comcast contracts out its metering to a third party vendor and its methods of measurement are internal and not open to the public at all. Just this year alone Comcast has received [thirteen thousand complaints about their data caps and their terrible accuracy in measurement](https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/The-FCC-Has-Received-13000-Complaints-About-Comcast-Data-Caps-135895).  Almost everyone who has to deal with this caps seems to have a story of their ISP charging them for data usage that would be impossible given their current bandwidth. 

**Discourages cord cutting and stifles competition:** 

Data caps exist solely as a consumer control measure to stifle competition and cause users to be biased against applications based on the data amount they use. For example [Netflix which lists high quality HD as using 3 GB per hour and Ultra HD as using 7gb per hour](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) is immediately affected by this. As Ultra HD becomes more common and using 7gb of data for an hour of video streaming becomes common place users affected by data caps will hit their limits more easily causing them to be charged overages. This will cause users to drop Netflix in favor of less data intensive services which Comcast will only be too happy to provide through cable. Families of five living in a home with heavy Netflix usage will already be pushing this current limit.

This isn't just for videos of course, people who use services like Steam will be hit just as hard especially as the size of games increases, data intensive services that would have otherwise been developed will languish on the vine as data caps cause consumers to be biased against them.  

**Users have little choice in what ISP they must subscribe to:**

The Internet is no longer a luxury that most can live without. For many it has become an essential utility much like electricity.

In any thread regarding complaints against Comcast or any ISP for that matter the main complaint of users is that they have no choice in their ISP (""Save us Google Fiber!""). Those lucky enough to live in major metropolitan areas may be fortunate enough to have the choice of maybe two or more ISPs but for many users the local ISP is the only choice they have which grants that business a monopoly in their area. In a happier world there would be dozens of ISPs each competing with each other and vying for market share so the poor behavior of one company only provides an opportunity for another to gain more customers. Sadly most Americans don't live in that kind of free economic environment. 


**What we need to do:**

How do consumers collectively fight this when they have little recourse in their choice of ISP?
The FCC is currently investigating data caps as a practice. If we as consumers just accept data caps the FCC will have less reason to crack down so it is imperative that the public puts pressure on the FCC. We're back to the Net Neutrality fight all over again as data caps are just a proxy issue that allows Comcast to achieve the same thing it wanted with its draconian net neutrality rules. 

Some users may be currently exempt from data caps but this behavior will absolutely roll down hill to other ISPs once they realize that consumers will accept it. Then you'll have to deal with your own little small town version of Comcast with little recourse. 

Much like the behavior of the last Net Neutrality fight calling the FCC directly has a huge impact. 

FCC Complaint Line:1-888-225-5322

[If you can't call directly you can file an online form to register your complaint.](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824)

Like before we need to raise public awareness of this issue and flood the FCC with our complaints and input so we don't have to deal with a stifled internet. 

**EDIT 1:**
Some users have mentioned that the online forum and phone line isn't working out for them.
Another number that you can use to submit a comment or complaint.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler: (202) 418-1000

This was also a number we used to contact in order to urge Tom Wheeler to stand for Net Neutrality once again we can call and urge Mr. Wheeler to stand with the internet once again. However please remember that there are real people on the other side of the line. 



**EDIT 2:**

**If you so choose to give the office of Tom Wheeler((202) 418-1000) or the FCC complaint line(1-888-225-5322) a call here's a handy script you can use. Feel free to add on or improvise on this:**

""I'm calling FCC Chairman Wheeler to urge him to stand with Internet users and pass strong, loophole-free rules against so called Data Caps. There is no legitimate, technical reason for these data caps. Comcast itself [admitted](https://gizmodo.com/comcast-will-cap-more-peoples-data-because-of-fairness-1740913276) in [internal customer service guidelines that these caps aren’t about network congestion](https://i.imgur.com/quf68FC.jpg). Instead, it claims these data caps are about “fairness,” but the broadband industry continues to see higher revenues and profits with lower costs overall and there’s no argument that these caps are based on any “fair” costs that Internet usage causes. The real reason behind these caps is to protect Comcast’s monopoly over cable TV, making it more expensive for customers to “cut the cord” even if they want to choose other video options. And by exempting only its own online video application from the cap, Comcast gives Stream TV an advantage over all competing online video applications. ""

Replace Comcast with your own local ISP or ISPs in general. 

*Script and sources shamelessly lifted from [Battleforthenet](https://www.battleforthenet.com/?title-x-committees=1#top).


**EDIT 3:**

The key to this fight will sadly not be a single set of calls made to the FCC but rather a sustained campaign of public pressure and complaint. Long after this thread's karma decays and it falls off the pages people still need let their voices be heard. There will be more threads in the future to bring attention to this we wont go down without a fight.

The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

Oh, and I'm also the UFC Bantamweight Champion and undefeated in MMA. I'm here today to answer your questions with the help of my friends Bobby and Leo. 

As many of you already know, I get a **lot** of questions about femininity and body image. Women are constantly being made to feel the need to conform to an almost unattainable standard of what’s considered attractive so they can support a multitude of industries buying shit in the pursuit of reaching this standard. 

So, I've decided to expand my support of the charity Didi Hirsch with their work in the field of women's body issues, and have partnered with Represent.com to [release a limited edition ""don't be a D.N.B."" shirt](http://represent.com/ronda), with a portion of proceeds benefiting this amazing cause. (For those of you who don't know- a ""D.N.B."" is a ""Do Nothing Bitch"")

I'll be answering your questions for the next ~34 seconds, so I'll have plenty of time for 50+ thoughtful answers.

It’s [the one that I will wear on my funeral](http://i.imgur.com/Ln8Yyqf.jpg?1) a few months from now. It may not match my suit, but I think it’s perfect for the occasion. 

The cancer diagnosis came too late to give me at least a tenuous hope for a long life, but I realized that the most important thing about death is to ensure that you leave this world a little better than it was before you existed with your contributions . The way I’ve lived my life so far, my existence or more precisely the loss of it, will not matter because I have lived without doing anything impactful.

Before, there were so many things that occupied my mind.  When I learned how much time I had left, however, it became clear which things are really important. So, I am writing to you for a selfish reason. I want to give meaning to my life by sharing with you what I have realized:

* Don’t waste your time on work that you don’t enjoy.
It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something that you don’t like.
Patience, passion, and dedication come easily only when you love what you do.

* It’s stupid to be afraid of others’ opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and go with it. Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you‘re a legend.

* Take control of your life
Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don’t procrastinate. **Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn’t.**

* Appreciate the people around you
Your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn’t take them for granted. 

It is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is. 

I'm not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful. I only regret that I will not be able to see a lot of cool stuff that should happen soon like the creation of AI, or Elon Musk’s next awesome project. I also hope that the war in Syria and Ukraine will end soon.

We care so much about the health and integrity of our body that until death, we don’t notice that the body is nothing more than a box - a parcel for delivering our personality, thoughts, beliefs and intentions to this world. If there is nothing in this box that can change the world, then it doesn’t matter if it disappears. I believe that we all have potential, but it also takes a lot of courage to realize it.  

You can float through a life created by circumstances, missing day after day, hour after hour. Or, you can fight for what you believe in and write the great story of your life. 
I hope you will make the right choice.

Leave a mark in this world. 
Have a meaningful life, whatever definition it has for you. Go towards it. The place we are leaving is a beautiful playground, where everything is possible. Yet, we are not here forever. Our life is a short spark in this beautiful little planet that flies with incredible speed to the endless darkness of the unknown universe. So, enjoy your time here with passion. Make it interesting. Make it count!

Thank you!

"[Theory] Jar Jar Binks was a trained Force user, knowing Sith collaborator, and will play a central role in The Force Awakens",66401,3qvj6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/3qvj6w/theory_jar_jar_binks_was_a_trained_force_user/,8205,1446231933.0,"Here I will seek to establish that Jar Jar Binks, far from being simply the bumbling idiot he portrays himself as, is in fact a highly skilled force user in terms of martial ability and mind control. 

Furthermore, I assert that he was not, as many people assume, just an unwitting political tool manipulated by Palpatine-- rather, he and Palpatine were likely in collaboration from the very beginning, and it's entirely possible that Palpatine was a subordinate underling to Binks throughout both trilogies.  

And finally, given the above, I will conclude with an argument as to why I believe it is not only possible, but *plausible* that Jar Jar will make a profound impact on the upcoming movies, and what his role may be.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

So first, let's **establish Jar Jar as a skilled warrior.**  While this does not in itself necessitate a connection with the Physical Force, it's highly suggestive in the Star Wars universe-- very rarely do we see ""normal"" characters exhibiting extraordinary stuntwork or physical feats unless they are Jedi, Sith, or at least force sensitives.

So here's [Jar Jar nonchalantly executing a standing 20 foot twisting somersault](http://gfycat.com/ThirstyEverlastingAmericanbittern).

Now, taken out of context, if you were watching a Star Wars movie and saw a character casually execute this maneuver, you'd probably assume it was a Jedi.  *In* the context of Jar Jar, though, we don't... because elsewhere he so thoroughly convinces us that he's nothing more than a harmless dunce with his inane dialogue and cowardly-lion act.

He also manages to convince us that he's a bumbling oaf in the midst of pitched battle... even though he's *always* incredibly, amazingly successful.  Whether single-handedly taking down a battledroid tank, or unleashing a barrage of boombas on their front lines, or precisely targeting multiple enemies with a blaster tangled around his ankle (!!!), we simply roll our eyes and attribute it to dumb ""luck.""  

But is it? [Obi-Wan warned us otherwise.](http://i.imgur.com/Y233Zgb.png)

This is one of the main reasons we as an audience hate Jar Jar so thoroughly;  he breaks the fourth wall, he he shatters our suspension of disbelief, because we know that no one is *really* that lucky.  We dismiss it as a lame, cliched trope-- the silly pathetic oaf who always seems to inadvertently save the day.

I posit that, instead, this is a deliberate facade on the part of Jar Jar as a character, and on the part of the writers and animators.  As we know, the Jedi themselves are inspired by Shaolin Monks, and there's a particular kung fu discipline that Jar Jar's physicality is purposefully modeled upon which allows him to appear goofy and uncoordinated even as he lays waste to his enemies; namely, [Zui Quan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zui_quan), or Drunken Fist wushu.  This discipline seeks to imitate the ""sloshing,"" seemingly random foibles of a drunkard, but in reality the staggering and stumbling is the use of bodily momentum, deception, and unpredictability intended to lure and confuse opponents.

Let's take a look at Jar Jar displaying some wushu (the compasion clips are taken from [an instructional Zui Quan video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU9-3J9CQwE)):

(if you [slow down the above gif](http://gfycat.com/EnormousColorfulIbisbill#?speed=0.125), you'll notice how Jar Jar *dodges* an incoming blaster shot at the very beginning. You'll also notice how he's mysteriously aware of the droideka as it appears behind him, even though it isn't in his line of sight and he couldn't possibly hear it over the din of battle....)

...ok, that's all well and good, but even *if* Jar Jar is a secret Drunken Fist boxing master, that doesn't make him a force user, right?  Well, it should at least make us suspicious of his character period.  It establishes that his over-the-top, childish antics are a veneer masking a more complex character than we're led to believe.  But even if you choose to ignore Jar Jar's seemingly magical prescience in battle, I believe that there is a particular scene in which we do see him *clearly* make use of the physical force...

In TPM, when Jar Jar and the Jedi ambush the droids and rescue the queen and her entourage, Jar Jar ""accidentally"" botches his leap from the balcony.  A few frames later, he is seen dropping from the *opposite* side of the balcony, which would seem to be quite be impossible without a force assisted jump and/or force sprint of some kind.  Let's take a look at the full scene:

[Jar Jar Ambush](http://gfycat.com/PrestigiousDefensiveBordercollie)

(Note that as they sneak up, Jar Jar is just as effortlessly stealthy as his Jedi counterparts.  Interesting.)

Now as I said, we see Jar Jar catch hold of the balcony on the far right side, but then he drops to the ground on the far left.  Easy to dismiss as a continuity or framing error, I suppose... except that one of the droids continues to fire on Jar Jar's initial position, even as we see him drop elsewhere!

[Here it is in slow-motion](http://gfycat.com/LinearAgreeableArachnid#?speed=0.5)

See the droid that comes charging up, right behind the one Qui-Gon chops down?  What's he shooting at up there??  And see its head swing back towards Jar Jars new position after the shot? You can also see another droid behind it tracking Jar Jar with its head, and manage a shot on the new position.  This means that the animators knew very well where Jar Jar was *supposed* to be- dangling from the balcony over Qui-Gon's left shoulder- and purposefully animate the droids tracking his inexplicably fast movement elsewhere.

I think what has happened here, even though we don't see it directly, is that Jar Jar has purposefully split the attention of the enemies by grabbing on to the balcony as he falls, and then (using the force) propelled himself with a pull-up/flip to land in an unexpected place.

In fact, [this is a maneuver we've seen before](http://gfycat.com/ChiefForcefulJellyfish)... from a jedi.  Twice, if you want to count Obi-Wan doing it in the Duel of Fates to take Maul by surprise.

In addition to this kind of highly suspicious physical ""luck,"" I also believe that we're given enough clues to justifiably suspect that **Jar Jar is also a master of Jedi Mind Control.**

Consider: We hate the way Jar Jar influences major plot points for the same reason we hate his physicality- *it messes with our sense of realism*.  Two experienced Jedi on a serious mission would never *actually* bring someone that stupid along with them.  No character that idiotic would ever *really* be made a general.  They certainly wouldn't be made a senator.  How could anyone like Jar Jar really convince the entire galaxy to abandon democracy? That's ridiculous.  

These things are just the political version of his physical ""luck.""  Inadvertent, seemingly comical bumbling that *just so happens* to result in astoundingly positive results.  But what if it isn't inadvertant, and what if Jar Jar's meteoric rise and inexplicable influence isn't the result of dumb happenstance, but the result of extensive and careful use of force mind powers?

Jedi (and presumably Sith) exhibit telltale signs when using the Mind Trick to implant suggestions or influence behavior.  For one, [they always gesticulate](http://gfycat.com/InferiorPoliteIsopod) and [not-so-subtly wave their hands at the target.](http://gfycat.com/DarlingWellgroomedIchthyostega) 

Here's a look at some pivotal Jar Jar moments during his political career:

[Jar Jar hand-waving his way towards a promotion to Bombad General]

[Jar Jar hand-waving his way towards a promotion to the Senate]
(http://gfycat.com/LameImmaterialEwe)

[Jar Jar using Force Persuasion as he hand-waves the entire Galactic Senate](http://gfycat.com/CheerfulHugeDutchsmoushond) and ushers in the death of democracy.

Actually, if you watch the prequels with the idea that Jar Jar might be a manipulative, dark character, you begin to notice just how insidious and subtle his manipulation is, and how effective, in almost every sequence he's involved in, and also just how hyper-aware of the overarching plot he really is.  

Examples: Jar Jar tricking the Jedi into traveling through the planet core (so that they need him).  Jar Jar carefully causing a scene so that they run into Anakin.  Jar Jar constantly mocking Qui-Gon behind his back while Anakin is watching (so that Anakin learns disrespect for Jedi authority early on).  Jar Jar telling an 8 year old child that the queen is ""pretty hot,""  fanning the flames of the child's infatuation that is exploited later on.  I could go on.  

Now if you lend even the slightest credence to my above points, and acknowledge the possibility that Jar Jar might *not* be an idiot, you're almost forced to conclude that **Jar Jar Binks and Palpatine were co-conspirators.**  If Jar Jar is putting forth an elaborate act to deceive people, it means he's not a fool... and if he's not a fool, it means his actions in Episode II that facilitate Palpatine's plans are not those of an unwitting tool- they are those of a *partner.* 

Remember- Palpatine and Jar Jar are from the same planet, which in the scale of the Star Wars universe is like growing up as next door neighbors.  It's entirely possible that they knew each other for years prior to TPM-- perhaps they trained together, or one trained the other.  And Naboo is a really strange planet, actually; remember those [odd ancient statues](http://i.imgur.com/yXgDgaF.jpg) with the third eye?  Naboo is the kind of place an ""outcast"" Gungan might find a Sith holocron or two.  

But that's just speculation.  Let's stick to what we know-- what we know is that even after Palpatine is elected as Chancellor, *years* after Jar Jar has been ""tricked"" into helping elect him, [Palpatine *still* hangs out with Jar Jar in RotS.](http://i.imgur.com/Ues6Llm.jpg).  Why?  Wouldn't he be a constant source of public embarrassment?  This is the same character who can't walk five yards without stepping in poodoo or squealing like a rabid donkey, right?  What use does he have now?   Why is he still at the right hand of the most powerful person in the galaxy?   Could it be that in fact Jar Jar ***is*** the most powerful person in the galaxy?

Fine.  Maybe.  Hilarious conspiracy theory, but why would George Lucas bother to create this devious Gungan character with an elaborate conspiratorial past, but then never actually reveal his true nature?

Here's George Lucas (from a documentary) talking about Yoda:

""Yoda really comes from a tradition in mythological storytelling- fairy tales- of the hero finding a little creature on the side of the road **that seems very insignificant and not very important**, but who turns out to be the master wizard, or the master thing...""

As we all know, one of Lucas' big deals with the prequels was that they were intended to ""rhyme"" and mirror the original trilogy in terms of general narrative themes.  So there *should* have been a seemingly innocent creature found on the side of the road that later reveals itself as a major player.  We *do* have a creature that this seems to describe precisely... Jar Jar... but of course he never develops into a ""master"" anything.

Here's what I think happened:  I think that Jar Jar was initially intended to be the prequel (and Dark Side) equivalent of Yoda.  Just as Yoda has his ""big reveal"" when we learn that his tottering, geriatric goofball persona is just a mask, Jar Jar was intended to have a big reveal in Episode II or III where we learn that he's not really a naive dope, but rather a master puppeteer Sith in league with (or perhaps in charge of) Palpatine. 

However, GL chickened out.  The fan reaction to Jar Jar was so vitriolic that this aspect of the trilogy was abandoned.  Just too risky... if Jar Jar is truly that off-putting, it's potentially ruinous to the Star Wars legacy to imply that he's the ultimate bad guy of the *entire saga*.  So pretend he was just a failed attempt at comic relief instead.  

This is why Dooku seems like such a flat, shoehorned-in character with no backstory; he was hastily written in to cover the plot holes left when villain Jar Jar was redacted.  Yoda was meant to duel with his literal darkside nemesis and mythological equivalent at the end of AotC: not boring old Count Dooku, but *Sith Master Jar Jar*.  And Binks was meant to escape, not just that duel but to survive the entire trilogy... so that he could cast a shadow on the OT, too; you'd rewatch the originals knowing that the Emperor wasn't necessarily the big baddie after all... Jar Jar is still out there somewhere.  It would have been sort of brilliant.

***But*** I believe it is likely that the writers of the new trilogy will resurrect this idea.  Most people seem to think that Disney wishes to distance or somehow disassociate itself from the prequels... but this doesn't actually make any economic or marketing sense.  There is far more prequel-era based intellectual property to capitalize on than there is OT, if only because of the Clone Wars movie and series.  Billions of dollars in iconic toys, images, characters, games, park rides, etc that an entire younger generation grew up on.  Disney is not going to pretend that *over half* of the $4 billion in IP they bought simply isn't worth acknowledging.  

(and anyway, we have [behind the scenes TFA footage](http://i.imgur.com/SZwUBjd.jpg) clearly showing imagery being reused from the prequels.  Also, many of the flags above Maz's castle in the trailer are from TPM)

No, it stands to reason that one of their primary goals will be to reinvigorate and ultimately try to redeem the prequels in the eyes of the fanbase.  To elevate and improve them retroactively, as much as possible.  So how do you do that?

Jar Jar Binks has undoubtedly become the face of everything that is ""wrong"" with the prequels- he was too silly, too unbelievable, seemingly pointless.  If you are able to somehow change the nature of Jar Jar from embarrassing idiot to jaw-dropping villain, suddenly the entire prequel trilogy must be seen in a new light, because it becomes the setup for the most astounding reveal in film history:

**Jar Jar Binks is Supreme Leader Snoke!**

In Russia, there is a law which allow Roskomnadzor, Russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. Two years ago I tested how RKN react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. On of that websites was Reddit.

One thing I learned is that RKN doesn't want to block popular websites. They respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. [It was on 05/21/2013](https://img.bi/#/VN0xdFz!SUfwaAZuQ0OgFP6nJQpMgqpwENsQfA4KLn1gdqhZ). On 10st Aug 2015 they posted [a call to help them contact Reddit administration](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official VK page. Funny thing, but they called Psilocybe a plant. Several hours ago they [reported that Reddit is blocked in Russia](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). Seems like things changed.

How Reddit is blocked? Fully. As Reddit switched to HTTPS, there is no way to block special page.

Will I remove this post? No. I also think that Reddit administration needs to do nothing. This is important issue on freedom of speech, and only RKN want to violate it.

BTW, this post is a guide for indoor growing Psilocybe mushrooms in Russian. I'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read Russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to RKN.

UPD: [Russia unbans Reddit](https://meduza.io/en/news/2015/08/13/russia-unblocks-reddit) as they comply with request and blocked that post for Russian users.

You may have seen - my first album since 1993 is out today! You can get 50 on [iTunes, Amazon or Spotify](http://smarturl.it/RickAstleyS01), or even get the vinyl and signed photograph version on my [website](https://rickastley.tmstor.es/). 

But other than the album, I'm really excited to be hopping on Reddit today to talk with you guys! This is going to be a lot of fun, and I can't wait to get started.

I'll be here at 3pm ET to answer your questions, and u/courtiebabe420 will be joining me in person to help. She'll also help get proof up when we get started later today. 

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rickastley), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/rickastley), or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/officialrickastley/) and check out my music on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/RickastleyCoUkOfficial) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0gxyHStUsqpMadRV0Di1Qt).

Okay - keep the questions coming. See you guys at 3pm (eastern) today!

Edit: [Proof](https://twitter.com/rickastley/status/784460789113430016)

Let's get started!

Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, the area around the parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water.

NASA TRAPPIST-1 News Briefing (recording) http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/100200725
For more info about the discovery, visit https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/trappist1/

This discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – key to life as we know it – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.

At about 40 light-years (235 trillion miles) from Earth, the system of planets is relatively close to us, in the constellation Aquarius. Because they are located outside of our solar system, these planets are scientifically known as exoplanets.

We're a group of experts here to answer your questions about the discovery, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, and our search for life beyond Earth. Please post your questions here. We'll be online from 3-5 p.m. EST (noon-2 p.m. PST, 20:00-22:00 UTC), and will sign our answers. Ask us anything! 

**UPDATE (5:02 p.m. EST):** That's all the time we have for today. Thanks so much for all your great questions. Get more exoplanet news as it happens from http://twitter.com/PlanetQuest and https://exoplanets.nasa.gov

[Here's a rough schematic of what the code looks like without revealing any trade secrets or compromising the integrity of the algorithm.](https://i.redd.it/dastklohq01y.gif)  Many of these rules are still quite useful, but there are a few whose primary impact has been [to sometimes artificially deflate scores on the site](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/z1sfn/one_minute_obamas_ama_karma_score_was_16000_a/).  


Unfortunately, determining the impact of all of these rules is difficult without doing a drastic recompute of all the vote scores historically… so we did that!  Over the past few months, we have carefully recomputed historical votes on posts and comments to remove outdated, unnecessary rules. 


Very soon (think hours, not days), we’re going to cut the scores over to be reflective of these new and updated tallies.  A side effect of this is many of our seldom-recomputed listings (e.g., pretty much anything ending in /top) are going to initially display improper sorts. Please don’t panic. Those listings are computed via regular (scheduled) jobs, and as a result those pages will gradually come to reflect the new scoring over the course of the next four to six days.  We expect there to be some shifting of the top/all time queues.  New items will be added in the proper place in the listing, and old items will get reshuffled as the recomputes come in.  


To support the larger numbers that will result from this change, we’ll be updating the score display to switch to “k” when the score is over 10,000. Hopefully, this will not require you to further edit your subreddit CSS.   


**TL;DR** voting is confusing, we cleaned up some outdated rules on voting, and we’re updating the vote scores to be reflective of what they actually are. Scores are increasing by a lot. 

**Edit**: The scores just updated.  Everyone should now see ""k""s.  Remember: it's going to take about a week for top listings to recompute to reflect the change. 

**Edit 2**: K -> k ",top_subreddit,1,2016-12-06 14:48:08

We’re privacy advocates trying to stop it. Join us and call your lawmaker to vote no on the bill: https://stopcyberspying.com and https://decidethefuture.org

The reason you keep hearing about these bills is that we keep beating them. The other side has full time lobbyists pushing them every single day. We have you. But together, we keep winning.

With your help, we've stopped CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, and other ""cybersecurity"" bills for years; however, they keep on coming back. Last week, the Senate scheduled CISA for a  final vote TOMORROW. We've been here before. And you already know the bill is a [surveillance bill in disguise](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/eff-strongly-oppose-cisa-cyber-surveillance-bill-and-cfaa-amendment).

People have sent millions of faxes (you read that right) to Congress, tweeted at senators, sent emails, and made calls. Over 50 organizations and companies oppose the bill including Access, ACLU, EFF, FFTF, Apple, Yelp, Twitter, and Wikimedia.

Fortunately, CISA isn’t law yet, but it will have its final Senate vote this week and we need a dozen more senators to vote against it. Two things you can do right now:

* [Call your lawmakers to vote no on the bill this week] (https://www.stopcyberspying.com) 

* [This is the fastest way to tweet at your senators](https://www.decidethefuture.org)

TIFU by thinking divorce was an April Fools Gag,47165,b8mhmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b8mhmf/tifu_by_thinking_divorce_was_an_april_fools_gag/,3576,1554227390.0,"Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

My borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. They told the family they are getting divorced. I broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying I'm no april fool.

*Edit*

Wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

*Edit 2*

I don't think I'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. This blew up and I just got multiple texts from my wife telling me I fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... And I didn't change any names 

*Edit 3.0*

Ok it's been fun everyone, I may see you all again next week with tifu by making a tifu post about divorce that ultimately lead to my own divorce. 

*Edit 4.0*

Uhh this post is getting deleted. It's been fun, just got home from work my wife is pissed.

*Edit 5*

Final edit. Fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. Apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on Reddit) how big of a dumbass I am.

Thanks for everyone who said I'm not the asshole. I may have autism, but I'm not an asshole. 

*Edit 6*

Once again was wrong, /pinnacleclub what up

Give me a couple days to sleep on releasing the video. I've got it, I've just got to convince my wife to release it. ",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 12:49:50

As one might guess the reactions were mixed to say the least. 

Today the promised meta thread on yesterday's event was published, and quickly became flooded. 

[Thread sorted by controversial](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/b8b9j2/april_fools_day_post_aftermath_discussion_meta/?sort=controversial&st=jtzk6wr1&sh=7fe88f97)

[It may not be prevalent on this sub but the discussions about it on subs like /r/pcgamingproved the mods correct about the gaming community.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/b8b9j2/april_fools_day_post_aftermath_discussion_meta/ejwv02b/?st=jtzkkttq&sh=f8e2f301)

[I honestly think the only reason that kind of behavior isn't accepted is because the mods clamp down on it so it doesn't fester. It's super easy to find gaming communities on reddit and other sites that are toxic as Hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/b8b9j2/april_fools_day_post_aftermath_discussion_meta/ejwu4pc/?st=jtzrzcbb&sh=c82256b2)

[The reaction proved the moderation team point. The gaming community is too negative and full of hate. Unfortunately the alt right infected our hobby. I don't think that anything will ever changes and this sub will be even worse now, but at least you raised awareness about how toxic gaming communities became. Thanks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/b8b9j2/april_fools_day_post_aftermath_discussion_meta/ejwv4o2/?st=jtzk8k9u&sh=96a23caa)

Some people disagree with the mods,

[Yeah Mods need a reality check. I mean that with no venom or acrimony. If this sub wants to preserve honest and open discussion then they made a serious misstep.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/b8b9j2/april_fools_day_post_aftermath_discussion_meta/ejwuh7x/?st=jtzkjx26&sh=01fe027a)

It's a funny read though IMO.)

[I don't even care. Just waiting for people to post actual content now so we can all forget about you wasting our time by shutting down an aggregate, and making us actually spend five seconds looking for news instead of having it all in one place.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/b8b9j2/april_fools_day_post_aftermath_discussion_meta/ejwtfn6/?st=jtzshfnw&sh=f42515de)

There's obviously more drama in the thread, this is just a few select choices. It's worth mentioning that most of the comments linked to are in support of the mods, which is due to that being the controversial opinion in the thread. If you sort by controversial chances are you'll notice a similar trend (at least I did when looking through the thread). 

If there's anything that needs changing then please tell me!

Edit: Just so everyone remembers, please don't piss in the popcorn.

AITA for thinking a divorce announcement due to an affair was an April fools joke?,13305,b8m3yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b8m3yb/aita_for_thinking_a_divorce_announcement_due_to/,1491,1554225563.0,"Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. 


Am I the asshole?

Can't wait until Thursday....My(48M) wife(44F) is going to be SHOCKED,30267,b8kigy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b8kigy/cant_wait_until_thursdaymy48m_wife44f_is_going_to/,1579,1554218103.0,"So, wife and I have been together 17 years.  We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist.  Come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  So, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from Ireland and custom designed, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  She was absolutely GUTTED.  I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was.

Begin Sherlock Holmes Mode.  I googled until I couldn't google anymore.  I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  I searched some more.  I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait......

I finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

Fast forward a couple of weeks.  I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS!  She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

I open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  OF OUR RINGS.  She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one.  She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

Our ""New"" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday.

Trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place.

\*Edit - I rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her I was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  The absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to NOT tell her as we tell each other EVERYTHING.  So now I not only need to figure out HOW to do this, but NOT to spill the beans until then.  (Our friends nicknamed us Mickey and Mallory as well as Marshall and Lilly from ""How I Met Your Mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*Edit 2 - I thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where I actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (VA Nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so ALWAYS goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when I originally proposed, I waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*Edit 3 - And to those of you saying ""I"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  SHE is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  She is the reason I breathe, and supported all of us when I went back to school to achieve my TWO doctorates to advance my career.  She is my hero.  I wake up every day to earn her all over again.  This was one small thing I was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why I have a heartbeat.  And I don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if I seem sappy.  If a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

**\*Edit 4 - Dang guys!  Never expected this kind of response.  So, for those wanting info about the jeweler.  I sent an email to them requesting permission to publicize what they did and who they are (and a link to this post).  Once I get a response, I will either post their information, or their response, in my Update - Which I guess I am now going to do at the request of so many.  I will update either Friday Night or Saturday Morning - I was going to do this Thursday when the rings came in, but now that this whole thing has taken on a life of its own, will be doing it on our ""regular"" date night.  Also, having her aunt and uncle there will not raise an eyebrow as it is not uncommon to have multiple people/friends/family show up at this local restaurant.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR Wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, I went Hardy Boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  Was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

\*\*\*And for those complaining about there not being any advice.  My advice is this.  If something shitty happens, don't just give up.  Try to find a solution, try to be ""That Guy/Gal"".  The one that gets shit done, and goes out of his/her way to make his/her partner happy.  Small stuff matters.  Smile at them for NO REASON, and when they ask ""what?"", reply ""Nothing"", and keep smiling.  Don't call names, ever, even if they do when you are arguing.  Randomly tell them they're ""hot"", ""beautiful"", ""sexy"".  Put THEM on a pedestal, and they will put you on one as well.  Hope that counts as ""advice""......Oh, and KISS your Partner....without context, expectation, or reason.",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 10:15:03

Originally, this was supposed to release on Friday. However, I decided to release it early, as the previous post grew much larger than I anticipated. So, without further ado, here it is in its entirety:

&#x200B;

**D2Y3**: Not much detail is known outside of the business model and a small detail about the content. There will not be another Comet DLC (Taken King, Rise of Iron, Forsaken) to kick off D2Y3. In its place will be an Annual Pass 2.0 style model, however there will be a slightly larger DLC in it's first entry instead of every DLC being around the same size.

&#x200B;

**Locations:** Old Chicago, Europa, and a return to Venus have been confirmed.

&#x200B;

**Endgame locations:** The immense pyramid-like ship that has been teased since D2 vanilla, and was also seen as a hologram in the queen's court. This is the flagship of a new enemy race which will serve as the main threat in the story. This location in essence would become the ""Dreaming City"" of D3.

&#x200B;

**New Enemy Race:** Astrodemons known only as the Veil. Their visual appearance is described as having dark greenish skin, sharp claws, and having a distinct stench of 'wet earth' as mentioned by Ada-1's mother in the lore entries brought with Black Armory. It is also worth noting that the Veil, being the true servants of the darkness are on an equal power level to guardians, if not stronger.

&#x200B;

**Story:** During the collapse, the god of the Veil was slain in a conflict with the light.  Since then, the Veil have been waiting for the Traveler to re-awaken so they can syphon it's power to resurrect their dead god.

&#x200B;

**Abilities:** Darkness based abilities are confirmed, however I am unsure of any changes/additions to the traditional subclasses.

&#x200B;

**New Game Design:** Open-world PvPvE areas, more akin to PlanetSide than to the Division. Crucible and sandbox changes are unknown.

&#x200B;

**Direction:** The goal of D3 is to cater to the hardcore audience more than anything. This game will be supposedly much more difficult than previous entries, and will very much focus on how the hardcore community of the franchise will play. D3 will also provide more RPG elements in it's approach design compared to previous entries in the franchise.

&#x200B;

***Disclaimer:*** *Because these are all leaks from before Anon went dark, these are all early development decisions and are subject to change. In addition, outside of the penumbra info and what you read here today, I am unaware of any confirmed or otherwise evident changes to current or future information.*

&#x200B;

**About the 4chan post:**

To address the many questions I received about my comments on the 4chan leaks, this is all I have to say: The leaks that were posted were a combination of legitimate leaks from Anon mixed with their own theory and speculation, but presented as a true leak. Whether or not Aphelions, faction oriented gameplay design, us teaming up with the cabal and fallen, calus having a “major” presence in the story, or 12 man raids are talked about, the bottom line is that none of those things are present in any credible leaks anywhere. What is in this post talking about D3 is what is known 100% as straight from Anon and no one else. There is no spin, and there is no angle.

Zero Waste is a process- can't we all be supportive?,2205,b8lvg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/b8lvg6/zero_waste_is_a_process_cant_we_all_be_supportive/,318,1554224468.0,"I subscribed to this sub to gain tips on my zero waste journey, and I know a lot of other have done the same. However, I've been disappointed in some of the responses to posts on this sub. Can't we all just be supportive?

&#x200B;

Zero waste is a journey. It shouldn't be done cold turkey (reduce, ***reuse***, recycle) and I think anyone coming here proud of their accomplishments should be supported, however small they may be. If someone has made the switch to shampoo bars, instead of admonishing them for buying online maybe we should congratulate them for making the switch?

&#x200B;

If we have suggestions, can't we say it nicely?

""I love shampoo bars! I buy mine at my local health food store, have you checked yours? They may carry some so you don't have to pay for shipping!"" ""I've tried that brand! I wasn't a fan though because it left a lot of soap scum in my hair. Try this other brand, they also ship in 100% recyclable materials!""

""Good for you for finding a sustainable option for buying milk. I make my own oat milk, but if I ever had to buy cow's milk I'm glad I know there's a sustainable option. Let me know if you'd like my recipe!""

&#x200B;

We, as a community, should be SUPPORTING people for making steps to live a more sustainable life, NOT tearing them down because they aren't making the same choices you would be. There's a way to make suggestions in a supportive way. Some people still want to eat dairy and meat. Some people want to go vegan. Ultimately it's their choice and we should provide support and advice to them (if they ask for it) to live their lives **the way they choose to.**

&#x200B;

Edit: GOLD???? Thank you, kind redditor! I will be sure to pay it forward.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Some of these discussions have turned into veganism and the carbon footprint of animal products. While I don't deny that animal products are not the most sustainable food you can eat, I think we should remember the essence of this post- we should be encouraging others to make steps in the right direction! Not everyone has the means or the desire to be vegan, **but they can be zero waste in other totally legitimate ways.** ",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 12:01:08

I'm at my local Wally-world (Wal-Mart) dressed in my Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and just not looking anything like an employee of Wal-Mart. I am with my cart, grabbing chips and salsa for a gathering I have this evening. A nice gal of about 5 foot nothing asked me to help her get some chips from the upper shelf (Why is it the shelves for the chips are always empty at this Wal-Mart?) I, being 6'6 get asked often to grab things from the high shelves. I feel for you vertically challenged folks. So I grab the chips and pass them to her. She thanks me and goes on her way. Then it happens. The HUFF! I turn and see her, she says now that you’re done flirting! Where can I find the batteries? I chuckle and say well what kind, she cuts me off and starts clapping WHERE! clap, ARE clap, THE! Clap BATTERIES! Clap. I then say, I'm sorry, you don't need to clap, I don't work here.

(It's the rudest form of communication possible.) I say, they are over in the automotive section. Just talk to one of the service techs out there... She storms off. I continue my shopping when about 5 minutes later, I hear the scream. THAT’S NOT WHAT I WANTED!!! WHERE IS THAT @$$H)LE Associate! I start grinning, here it comes. She hunts me down and says, they only have car batteries there!!! I wanted small batteries for electronics. I look at her, I Smile, and then say, YOU! clap WERE clap, NOT clap SPECIFIC! Clap. Her mouth Drops open, She gasps like I just stole all the oxygen from the area. She then says ""where is your manager!!!"" Now I work remotely for my company, my manage works in a different state.

"I was a phone sex operator when I was around 21 or 22 years old. It wasn't as ""sexy"" as I thought it was going to be.",2769,b8ptbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/b8ptbm/i_was_a_phone_sex_operator_when_i_was_around_21/,222,1554243612.0,"This is a repost from a comment I made in a different thread.  Thought it belonged better here. 

I used to be an ""Adult Phone Actress"" which is the fancy term for phone sex operator when I was in my early 20s.

How I ended up with that job was because I saw some special on HBO about these girls making money while working from home talking all sexy on the phone while they painted their toenails and stuff.  In my young and niave head I thought that it looked so glamorous 🤣. 

I thought ""Work from home and all I have to do is talk ""sexy"" to guys while I paint my toenails and lounge about and eat grapes and shit?? I can TOTALLY do that!!""

I thought it was perfect because at the time,  commuting was out of the picture because my car had shit the bed,and it costed more to repair it than what the car was actually worth. 

So I went online and looked for phone sex operator jobs and found one pretty quickly. Super easy setup. Just had to use a landline and headset and I got to set my own hours. When my shift began, I called this toll free number, signed in with my numeric code, and then just waited until someone came into my line.

 Mind you, I lived in a small town surrounded by dairy farms and corn fields with a population of about 4,000 people and the few businesses we had were mom and pop places, even the grocery store. The nearest Cub or Target was a 30 minute drive. Our town didnt even have a stop light, but it had 15 bars, 10 of which were all within crawling distance from eachother. 

Once my friends found out, holy shit did word get out about my job. All of a sudden,  I was the most interesting girl in town amongst my network of friends and peers. I'd go to the bar, and random people would approach me and want to know all about it and were completely fascinated. 

This sounds completely stupid, but  I became somewhat of a local celebrity to almost all the people in my town that were in my age group,  and being a dumb 22 year old who loved to party on the weekends, I thought it was pretty awesome. I was invited to tons of parties, and at said parties the entire room would go silent and intently listen when I started talking about my weirdest, most recent phone sex stories.  Everyone wanted to hang out with me.  Sooo many people would come over while I was working and would listen and silently giggle in the back ground because A LOT of my calls were into some fucking wild shit.

And not gonna lie, for the first couple months,  the calls I was getting,  albeit wierd and unusual,  WAS pretty fun... *at first*

 After a couple months,  I realized that the job wasn't as sexy and glamorous as HBO made it look. And it became less and less fun and interesting to me.

Only like 15% of my calls were regular ""talk sexy to me while I jerk off"" kind of calls. 

All the rest were REALLY bizarre; strange fetishes,  extreamly weird roleplaying,  and some were down right disgusting. Granted, it made for some very  entertaining stories to tell at parties and stuff, but that job started getting really old for me real quick though. I started to hate it. It became mentally exhausting keeping up and acting like I was ""TOTALLY turned on"" talking to these callers about piss and shit Martinis and other really dark and twisted fantasies. 

Being that my car was broken down,  and no one was really hiring in my town, I had to stick with it for a while until I figured out how to get a new car.

Thankfully,  I ended up getting a good deal on a used car with the help of my Dad. Once I got hired for a job in sales,  I didn't even bother putting in my two weeks with the PS job.  I just unhooked my phone and no showed them.  Lol


EDIT: I still have fun telling stories of some of my weirdest most fucked up calls. So , if anyone is curious, let me know. I'll post it in the comment section. I'll try to keep it as clean as possible.  Lol

I bought a house in 2017 and moved in with my BF. The homes are really close to each other and you can see into neighbour yards. First thing i did was make my walls higher, add some burglar proofing on the walls and surround my perimetre with potted plants and ferns to get more privacy. Also got 2 Puppers! Woo! 

Neighbour - lets call her Susan, gives me sh!t on the very first day. My dad installing a new pipe for the washing machine at 14:00 on a Saturday is just too much. Her todler cant sleep. 

Fast forward a couple of months. My plants in the front yard starts dying, and my herbs refuse to grow. My dogs are kept in the back so.. clueless, until I spot Susan's cats taking a dump in my potted plants.  Also, the cats ripped open my trash bags, and knocked my BF's dumbell off the shelf in the garage, and onto my car. 

I give up on the garden, purchase an out door trash can and move the gym equipment from the garage into the house. Not about to start a feud. 

Then BF surprises me with a bunny, and we build a nice big cage in the back yard. Bunny and puppers are all friends and life is good! 

Then Susan's cats start targeting the bunny. Trying to get into the cage. My dogs bark, and chased the cat away, all whilst Susan's todler is standing on the back porch taunting the hell out of my dogs. 

Next thing I know, the SPCA is at my door. And so is Susan. Told the spca i was neglecting my dogs, not feeding them for days etc etc etc. The spca did 3x unannounced homechecks, found nothing wrong. Susan retracted her complaint only to start mumbling about noise of dogs barking. Spca left, as they dont deal woth noise, only cruelty. 

Susan was outraged and started yelling, ""YOU HAVE SHIT COMING YOUR WAY! JUST YOU WAIT! I HAVE PHOTOS OF YOUR YARD, AND THERE ARE LEAVES EVERYWHERE! AND YOUR DOG SHEDS FUR! YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT, YOU HAVE NO IDEA, HOW MANY CONTACTS I HAVE IN HIGH PLACES!""

I told her to leave and get back to her yard, or I would call the police, so she went back to her ... hole.. 

True as Bob, someone from the dept of health phones us, but seemed reluctant to state his credentials or name. Probably a friend of hers that did not quite pack the rank to actually have a viable threat. 

Then I waited. Not a week later, a vehicle is blocking my garage and driveway. I take photos from within my garage and the curb. 

I remember the lady up the street once said that Susan was a hair dresser and worked from home. 

I have a contact that works for lawyers. With a home adress, we found out that Susan is the owner of that title deed, and all of her information such as identity number, full names and so forth - kind of like a private investigative report. 

I then got the forms to fill out a protection order of harassment, stating that she admitted to taking pics of my private property and sending it to people and all the other crap. 

I also sent an official complaint to the local municipality to report her home business, which is not zoned or registered - and it is a traffic safety hazard - I attached the photos of vehicles blocking me in my yard. 

A third complaint went to health dept to state that she has cats living where she is running a hair salon - another by law no no. 

A fourth complaint went in to the tax revenue service - with all her personal details - as a report of possible tax fraud as her home business is unregistered and she is definitely making money since she bought a new car last year - and probably not tax registered. I also listed that she owns a car and house, describing the assets, registration number and her adress, so she cannot hide it from them. And i submitted it anonymously. 

I am now patiently waiting for the outcome, but I am pretty sure it will be satisfying. Will update in a week or two with new developments. 

Moral of the story, dont say ""i know people in high places"" to a former journalist.

The fact that we have the teams that we do, the upward trajectory that we enjoy, as well as the security to plan for another 20+ years is something we should all be thankful for. Kids have been born and can legally drink and MLS has always existed in their lifetime. That is amazing.

* Eliminate the timer entirely - it's annoying for anyone doing a 1, 2, or most level 3 raids.
* Instead of the timer, have whoever gets there first get an option when they use their pass to ""Go it alone"" or ""Wait for friends""
* In the world map, have a visual change to the gym indicating there is someone who is waiting for friends, and a number of people waiting to raid.
* Give players who are within range to see the gym on their map an option to signal ""On my way!"" to let the folks at the raid know what's happening, and when they click this, have their location reflected on a mini-world-map that the folks waiting to raid can see so they can decide whether to wait for them.
* As people join, the option presents on all joined raiders to ""Start raid"" or ""Wait for friends"" - majority vote rules - original person breaks ties.
* Once the vote is to start the raid, have a 90 second timer to set teams and give stragglers a chance to join.
* Automatically start the raid if waiting would result in the raid ending and not being available.

​

Something to consider would be whether to allow raiders to continue playing all other aspects of the game while they wait for friends to join so that they aren't tied to that location (basically just stay within a couple minute walk/run of that gym in case folks launch the raid).",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 07:58:26

"Chili. High protein, low carb, generally low calorie, low cost.. where have you been all my life?",2128,b8ljrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/b8ljrm/chili_high_protein_low_carb_generally_low_calorie/,277,1554222958.0,"I do meal prep Sundays and am on a high protein/kinda low calorie diet. I usually cook a bunch of chicken to eat throughout the week in various forms, but still needed protein shakes/bars to hit my goals. 

A few weeks ago I decided to make a pot of chili. I did it while I'm prepping my marinade, marinating and what not. I had generally made chili in the slow cooker which I now think is kind of a waste of time when it can be done so quickly on the stove.

Holy smokes. For such little effort, you can have loads of healthy, high protein, low calorie, entirely customizable food to eat all week!

My last batch consisted of:

*  2 lbs 90% lean ground beef

*  1 can chickpeas

*  1 can pinto beans

*  1 can black beans

*  2 10oz cans rotel

*  3oz tomato paste

*  1 small can diced jalapenos

*  1 whole yellow onion

*  1 green bell pepper

*  1 red bell pepper

*  3 tbsp pre minced garlic (I know, I know)

Edit:

*  Forgot I squeezed half a lime into it and also poured like 1/4-1/2 the lager I was drinking in there. Otherwise, No liquid necessary although it's a thick, chunky chili which is how I like it!

Spices: Cumin, chili powder, oregano, smoked paprika, cayenne, fresh cracked salt and pepper.

The list seems long, but seriously, **all you do is chop an onion and two bell peppers, then it's all opening cans.**

The little amount of work for so much tasty and healthy food kinda blows my mind. 

I fill five smallish tupperwares with chili to grab and go for a 10 AM breakfast at work. Have a smallish cup of chili during lunch with my main dish (chicken sandwich, lately). Last night for dinner I chopped up one of my pre-cooked chicken breasts and put it on a salad, with a side soup of.. chili! 

If you lift or exercise at all, protein is very important for rebuilding torn muscles and other functions. 

**Customization:**

If you don't like ground beef or want a more lean meat, you can sub it for turkey or chicken (chicken has that protein boost as well).  [Here](https://www.budgetbytes.com/weeknight-black-bean-chili/) is a great turkey blackbean chili that's even more simple to do. I did this one two weeks ago. 

You can do 3 beans, one bean or no bean! I've made a three meat chili that just had ground beef, cubed chuck roast and ground pork. No beans about it. I personally prefer beans for their own health benefits you don't get from meat. 

Anyway, just wanted to share this for any meal preppers out there!

Edit to add: this is a pretty meat heavy chili, which is how I like it. You can do this same recipe with 1lb, 1.5lb or 2lb ground beef depending on how much you like. Just change your amount of seasoning appropriately! :D

**Edit 2: Some people have pointed out this isn't ""low carb"" because of all the beans and they are right. It's hard for me to lump complex carbs and processed carbs together, so when I think carbs I usually think bread/processed grains/chips etc.**

**What you can do about that is: don't add beans! Or just add chickpeas, or just pinto beans, or black beans! Just one can. It will still be fine without them, just even more meaty. A way to fluff it up and keep it low carb is to add more of another kind of meat (breakfast/italian sausage, chuck roast cubed into 1in cubes, chicken). Sorry for the misinformation on the carb department. Also, you can dice up some mushrooms! Personally, I still think this recipe is a little on the low to mid range carb wise since it's mostly meat, haha**

Edit 3: just adding more good ideas: if you get bored with it, you can make it into a quesadilla! Slap some on a tortilla and put some shredded cheese on there. Boom!

Another edit: someone PMd me for instructions and since I typed it all out on my phone, figured I’d post it here:

Dice the yellow onion and green and red pepper. Set aside. 

Put 2 tbsp olive oil into a large pot and heat on medium. As the diced onion and garlic. Cook for 3-5 minutes. Add beef and red and green pepper.  Stir occasionally until meat is browned. This should only take ten minutes or so. 

While this is going on, start opening cans. And if you want and aren’t drinking already, open a beer. 

Add the rotel, jalapeños, beans, tomato paste.. just like everything that was in the cans I guess. 

Now seasonings: 

1.5 tbsp cumin

1 tbsp chili powder
  
1-2 tsp oregano

1-2 tsp smoked paprika

1/2 tsp cayenne

12-15 cranks cracked salt and pepper 

Let me know if I forgot one something. 

Splash a little beer in there. Squeeze lime in there if you have some. 

Do you have any ingredients left? Let me know. They should probably be in the pot by now though! 

Stir occasionally so it doesn’t burn to the bottom of the pot. Let simmer for like, 1-2 hours on low-med heat after cooking on med for like ten-15 minutes. 

Serve immediately or let cool in the fridge overnight and eat it all week! It’s tastier the next day imo",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 11:35:58

Usually shotguns are the things people complain about in every modern shooter, whether it's CoD or BF or even Destiny (especially Destiny), but in this game (and kind of in the first Division as well), shotguns feel super underwhelming.

So for a game that emphasizes (and in harder difficulties outright requires) using cover, the role of shotguns is basically for those ""oh fuck"" rusher moments where you don't have time to wait for your AR or LMG to mag dump a purple bullet sponge. I can't think of many scenarios where you're using a shotgun offensively, since willingly getting close to enemy groups guarantees you'll be surrounded within seconds. So the shotgun should be the perfect panic weapon, right? But in almost all cases the answer is a resounding nope. Most every high rate of fire SMG that I have handles that role better, even when compared to the heavy hitter shotguns.

Which sucks, because the shotguns in this game are gorgeous, and extremely satisfying to use (from the feel of blasting someone dead center, where you know every shot from the shell connected, to the sound of said blast and the accompanying CH-CHKK).

And yes, I've tried boosting shotgun damage. Gloves +11%, +15% from specialization, and even the ""3% damage for every 10% ammo missing"" perk, but the base damage is still too low for any amount of multipliers to have any great effect on.

Rate of fire, range, and shot spread all feel good to great depending on the shotgun class, but the damage across the board is extremely lacking to ever be viable against anything but non-mission open world red bars.",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 15:10:46

The one I worked at was in Maida Vale, a fairly wealthy neighborhood with several celebrity residents (Jude Law, for example). 

Anyway, I was an assistant supervisor in the pub and was always responsible for Sunday afternoon shift, which for those of you who are familiar with the UK knows, this means Sunday roast was a big deal. And we had a really good roast with all the fixins and we'd get really, really busy on Sundays with all of our tables full with people who'd come to eat and drink for half a day at least. 

For whatever reason, my manager had decided that, despite how busy we are on Sundays, that we only needed two people on the shift. Again, for those of you who are familiar with UK pubs, everyone typically orders at the bar, but it's table service, so me and the other person on shift were responsible for staffing the bar, pouring drinks, taking food orders, but also taking out the food, taking out cutlery and sauces, restocking, cleaning glasses, and bussing tables. You're essentially a cashier, bartender, and wait staff all at once. 

And then there was the one thing I hated the most - coffees. 

We had this old, slow, partially broken espresso machine which none of us had been properly trained on. Making coffee on it took AGES. The worst was that it would take so long that food orders would go out more slowly, and a queue would form at the bar of people wanting to order drinks. I hated having to leave customers waiting at the bar who just wanted a quick pint or soda while I fussed with the stupid coffee machine for 15 minutes. 

We all hated the goddamned coffee machine and complained about it constantly. Luckily, however, demand for coffee wasn't that high at the pub - given that it's traditionally a venue for drinking alcoholic beverages. But then, one day, corporate management announced that they wanted all their pubs to sell more coffee. In fact, they had quotas of coffee sales they wanted us to meet, and they wanted us to ask EVERY guest that was placing a food order if they wanted a fancy coffee drink like we were some sort of Starbucks or something, but they still didn't give us a new, proper machine, and they still provided us with exactly zero training on making espresso drinks. 

For the most part, on Sundays I ignored this edict. We were so slammed just with regular beverages and getting out Sunday roasts that adding obligatory coffees into the mix would be suicide. 

Then one Sunday, my manager was in the pub doing paperwork, and pulled me aside and said that he noticed our sales of coffee weren't what they should be, particularly on Sundays. He noted that Sunday afternoon should be our best day for coffee sales because everyone's in for roasts. He then perched himself next to the bar to work on his paperwork, and I could kinda tell he was doing this so he could monitor whether I was up-selling coffees or not. 

I tried to warn him. I said, ""You know, with only two people on shift, when the rush comes we're going to be really slammed. If I'm doing coffees as well as drinks and food service, there will be a significant delay.""

""Whatever, I'll jump on if things get out of hand,"" he said. 

So, I decided he should see how crazy Sunday's get, and just what adding coffees to the mix would do. As usual on a Sunday, a trickle of people start filling in to the bar around 11am, but by noon it's already two deep at the bar, all the tables are full, and there's two full lines of food tickets with multiple plates of starters, mains, and dessert. It's now that I and the other bartender start selling the coffees hard. We're telling everyone ""You know what would go well with that, a nice cappuccino, or maybe a latte!"" 

And they're all agreeing with me. I wait until I have about a dozen coffee orders all lined up, and I tell the other staff member that he's on the bar and food service, and I go over to start preparing them with our old, slow, crappy espresso machine. 

It's at this point that things go a bit haywire. Food starts coming down the food lift, and so the bartender is sprinting back and forth between the bar, the food lift, and the tables. The crowd at the bar is growing and becoming restless. They just want some beer, FFS! I'm going as fast as I can with the coffees... but honestly, it takes a really long time. 

Then my manager looks up and sees the angry mob at the bar, my colleague running around like a crazy person, and asks me ""Why aren't you pouring drinks?!""

I show him my tickets ""I have 20 fancy coffee orders!""

Manager decides to take over the coffees so I can go back to the bar, so I double down on the coffees. I'm getting people to order mochas, flat whites (I don't even know what that is, really, but now we sell them!), Irish coffees, coffee with shots of Baileys or Amaretto. I'm going wild. And my manager is visibly sweating and frustrated and cursing at our terrible coffee machine. And then the best thing happens. We run out of coffee cups and saucers. He's now making coffees in some Styrofoam cups he found in a closet. He's very close to making a cappuccino in one of those fancy Belgian beer goblets. And then finally, he comes up to me, all angry, ""Stop offering people fancy coffee drinks."" 

""But you said...""

""No more coffee drinks."" 

He never asked me to up-sell coffee ever again! ",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 13:37:22

He likes to joke around with the team, we all kind of rip on each other a little bit here and there. All in good fun though. I don't typically participate as much though, I am fairly new as well in this department.

Yesterday, I noticed new guy walking with a strange limp that I had never noticed before so I proceed to shout at him “Hey Michael! What’s with the gangster limp?”  
 He turns around, smiles at me and says “I just have a sore knee.”   
 I notice everyone in the office turn and look at me as he leaves the office. Nobody laughed, nobody smiled.  
 One of my co-workers looks at me and whispers, “He’s an amputee, he lost his right leg when he was a kid.""

UPDATE: I spoke with someone at the court and she was able to find the mix up. As many guessed the real victim and I share a first and last name but they had entered the wrong birthday. Thanks to everyone who offered advice or help. 

A few people suggested contacting the law firm on the subpoena which was what I had planned so I contacted them yesterday morning. After not hearing back yesterday I followed up today only to be told they don't get to decide who to send subpoenas to, they get the order from the court and they send it. The law firm suggested contacting the police station to get a copy of the report so I called them immediately after. Now for the big twist, after giving my name and city of residence I was informed that I am listed as the VICTIM of the case and the subpoena is to testify against this woman charged of domestic violence. I've requested a copy of the case report but I don't know where to go from there. At this point I'm fully expecting to have to go to court and tell them I have no idea who this woman is and she certainly did not attack me. Thanks for the people who commented in the original thread and offered advice. I'm not sure if there is anything else I can do at this point to avoid going to court. Would it be helpful to call the court itself and try and explain the scenario or does it all come back to this police report?",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 10:26:26

EM tries to cut in line at the American Embassy because she is American,5967,b8ljrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/b8ljrh/em_tries_to_cut_in_line_at_the_american_embassy/,267,1554222958.0,"Hello fellow redditors,

I'm French-American and live near Paris. A few months ago I had to renew my American passport because the old one had expired. It was the first time I had to renew it since I turned 18 (am 20 when this story happened), so I decided that I would go to the American Embassy (or Consulate, I'm not sure which one it is exactly) without my mother for the first time (she's American), to get things done on my own like a big boy. Usually hanging out with my mother in any public place means people immediately learn that we're Americans, seeing as we usually speak english when there isn't too many people and speak french in big crowds out of respect for the people around us, but her thicc accent usually rats us out as Americans. Anyways since she didn't come with me that day, it meant that people wouldn't automatically assume I was American (important for the rest of the story).

So the day of the meeting I show up at the Embassy, 15 minutes before the time of the meeting as instructed, and the line to get in is a MESS. There are two TSA checks, one outdoors and one indoors. In between the two the line of people is orderly, but before the first TSA check everyone was just bunched up and participating in the Hunger Games in order to get in before everyone else. When I got there I phoned my mother, anxious that I would be late for my meeting. She told me to just go to the TSA agents and tell them I had a meeting bla bla bla... when I hung up the french people around me told me that Americans had been called forth earlier, so I got to skip the first line by just waving my passport in the air. Turns out, having an American passport at the American embassy makes you a VIP ! 

So I'm waiting in line for the second TSA check, and I'm waiting for the TSA agent to call me into the building. As I'm waiting, I hear commotion behind me : some lady (EM) is pushing everyone aside, yelling ""I'm American I have priority let me through !"". She had a fivish year old boy with her. As she gets to my level she tries to push me aside, yelling ""I have to get my boy his passport"". Now, that woman was 5 feet tall with her arms up, and I'm 6 feet tall and, though I'm not very heavy (145 pounds) I don't budge easily. She looks at me in shock, as if I had killed her son or somewhat, and shouts ""How dare you ! I'm American, I have every right over you here, now let me pass !"" I had all my papers out in my left hand, and my current passport at the time was underneath it so she couldn't have known I was American. The TSA agent gestures to me to come forth, and EM starts cutting in front of me telling her boy ""come on (son's name) we can finally go in"" and yanks his arm. I gently but firmly grab her by the shoulder, stop her in her tracks and move forward. She looks me dead in the eye and says ""what is wrong with you ? I should go first, I told you I'm American !"" As she says so, I pull my passport from underneath my papers, wave it to her face, and say ""well so am I, bitch !"" That's when one of the TSA agents from the first control post came to take her back to the start of the line. As I entered the building, I shouted back : ""enjoy the line with the French people!!"" And proceeded with the protocol.

Long story short : don't fuck with people based on their assumed nationality, you might get a surprise 

EDIT : I've seen in the comments that people think my mother is from some rootin' tootin' part of Far West America because I said she had a thick accent. What I meant by that is that she had a very noticeable accent when she speaks in FRENCH (she can't make certain sounds like the french ""r"" for example, even though I can't hear it because I grew up hearing it all the time).

EDIT 2 : All the dialogues took place in english. Just because she assumed I was French, I didn't want to assume that she could understand it, so even when I nagged her I spoke in english  ",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 11:35:58

"My restaurant, after decades of letting people decide on their own, instituted an 18% autograt policy on parties of 8+ and it did not go as I expected.",643,b8qhp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/b8qhp0/my_restaurant_after_decades_of_letting_people/,73,1554247321.0,"This is a local owned, very popular greasy spoon diner. We have lots of regulars and lots of big parties. My last party of eight before we instituted this policy ran me for over an hour and left me just under $5. 

I have been bracing myself to hear people complaining about this policy for two weeks, and there has been almost  none of that. The first day, a party of nine saw the sign and asked the manager if that was actually the policy and when they were told yes, they threatened to leave and the owner and management let them go. Apparently the owner wants to start weeding out some of the cheap-ass customers that seem to love coming to our place. 
We all usually make pretty good money so we sort of accept/endure those customers as part of the cost of doing business. But no more.


The first party of 11 that I served I was a single check and the person paying the bill handed me their card without even looking at the bill. I hesitantly informed her that this was actually my first time adding a gratuity per restaurant policy and I still wanted to ask her permission to put the 18% on. She replied with a very sharp ""NO"" and my heart sank a little. Then she went on to say ""I want 20%."" At least half of the parties that I've auto-gratted have asked to add more. One woman tried to complain to the hostess when the tip was added to her portion of the split check because she had to ask twice for a to-go cup. I overheard her and offered to remove her $3 from the bill but she relented and we just let it be.

So far, there is a noticable increase in tip % against sales. We are incentivized to upsell and sales are up, but we are also experiencing an increase in business due to a temporary tourist influx in our area. Not sure how it will pan out in the long run. 



Does anyone have any tips on how to talk to customers about this? Do you have a specific way of presenting the bill and informing them that the tip is included? 


Any experiences you want to share about adding gratuities automatically?

YSK: Older GPS devices may malfunction on April 6th without a firmware update,700,b8s2o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/b8s2o1/ysk_older_gps_devices_may_malfunction_on_april/,38,1554256567.0,"Similar to y2k, the date system on older GPS devices will rollover to zero after April 6th. Some devices may just have a date error, some may crash, or some may direct you into a lake. Almost all cell phones should be fine, as well as the thousands of commercial systems.

It's those with the old car dash type GPS models, handheld hiking types, handheld for golf etc that may be impacted. Go to the vendor website and there should be a firmware update to patch it.

Main thing is that you should check the model your folks have been using since you bought it for them ten years ago for Christmas that's still mounted to their dash (see prior reference about driving into lake).

So if you’ve been drinking, or maybe you’re just riding dirty, and those cherries and berries pop up in your rear view, then whip out your cellphone and report shots fired as close as possible.  With some good luck the cop will be called off to investigate.

\*no spoilers beyond very high-level game structure discussion (D&D vs MOTW) and use of a few character/arc names\*

&#x200B;

So, I’ve been having some thoughts about TAZ in the back of my mind for a few months now, and I can’t seem to stop going over them again and again, so I’m putting them here in the hopes of getting them out of my head. And, maybe some others feel the same way and will be comforted to see their feelings reflected here.  If it's just me, that's okay too.  I just wanted to speak into the void about it for a minute.

**As a quick preface, before my thoughts:**

1. I’m a huge McElroy and TAZ fan. I’m a MaxFun subscriber. I’ve bought merch. I’ve been to Candlenights live in Huntington. I’ve turned others on to their shows. I am not writing this from a place of dislike or hostility.
2. I do not think I am entitled to any of what I describe below. I don’t think I'm entitled to anything beyond choosing whether or not to continue to enjoy the content they choose to make. I don’t think they work for me, and I am not writing this from a place of expectation.
3. I am writing this because, for years, TAZ meant the world to me, and now I can barely drag myself through each new Amnesty episode. The live episodes are what's keeping me subscribed.  I am writing this as much as a paean to what feels lost as a plea to what might be. I am writing this because I’m on the verge of making that choice to stop listening and it makes me sad.

**A Three-Legged Stool**

I think what made TAZ something special, during the Balance campaign, was the way it existed on multiple levels at once.  
To my mind, there were three key things happening at once, like a three-legged stool. Those three legs/levels were:

1. The McElroy family playing D&D together – play of the game
2. The characters within Balance playing together – play within the game
3. The narrative of Balance building to something moving – narrative and character arcs

I’ve listened to all of the TTAZZ’s, and seen all the side comments, and read all the interviews. I understand what changes they thought they were making with Amnesty and why they thought they should make them, but my contention is that what they’ve actually done is inadvertently knock two of the legs out from under the stool, causing the whole thing to fall over.

**Play of the Game**

What initially drew me to TAZ was this level of the show. The McElroys are delightful people who clearly care a great deal about each other, and being a fly on the wall as they played a game together was joyful. It felt like family game night growing up and like actual D&D games with my friends later on. Just as at one of those games, they spent a lot of time talking and joking with each other out of character, and they had sidebars about figuring out the rules and disputes about outcomes. They reveled in their new abilities and items and in finding creative ways to deploy them – both to solve challenges and to annoy and entertain each other. It felt real.

In contrast, Amnesty has eliminated almost all of this level of interaction. In pursuit of greater commitment to their characters, they now actively avoid speaking with each other out of character. In pursuit of a more serious tone, they’ve eliminated most of their OOC joking and teasing. Because MOTW has so few rules and mechanics, there is very little in the way of game logistics to discuss or debate. It no longer feels like listening to a family play a game. 

**Play within the Game**

The Balance campaign was also full of play within the game. Merle, Taako, and Magnus did not arrive as fully-formed characters; they evolved organically out of the way the boys played them over time. As they explored who they were and might be, there was great fun to be had. Their characters showed off for each other as much as the players did IRL, and the fantasy setting and D&D rules gave them freedom to approach situations in a wild range of ways. As they experimented and evolved, my investment in them evolved alongside, making it possible for those later-campaign emotional payoffs to really land. And, Griffin was able to play too, mashing up so many things he loves to create sets and settings only possible in the theater of the mind.

In contrast, Amnesty has eliminated almost all of this level of interaction. Again, in pursuit of more serious story-telling, the boys have eliminated most in-game goofs too. This problem has been exacerbated by: (a) their overdevelopment of their characters before play began, leaving little room for experimentation or evolution through play; (b) a realistic setting that severely limits everyone’s ability to improvise entertainingly; (c) a game structure that means there is always time-pressure driving a single narrative focus; and (d) a game structure that rarely gives players more than two things they can do in any situation. In trying to get away from their feeling of being too “railroaded” or “on rails” in Balance, they’ve inadvertently ended up somewhere that feels more locked on rails than Balance ever was.

**Narrative and Character Arcs**

Balance didn’t start with the goal of telling a serious, dramatic story. It certainly evolved into one – one that meant a great deal to a lot of people, including me. But that evolution happened over time, in the collision between Griffin’s storytelling and the boys play within and around it. By the time they got to later arcs, with high stakes and big payoffs, we’d all been on that journey of organic growth with them. We’d all seen them grow and had invested in them as they did. Griffin has commented about it being hard to maintain risk or stakes as the boys became more and more powerful, but I don’t think the stakes in Balance ever came primarily from fear of character death. It came from wondering whether Magnus could overcome his impulsiveness, whether Taako could overcome his selfishness, and whether Merle could overcome his insecurity. It grew organically from seeing how Griffin would challenge those characters in individualized ways and whether those characters would rise to those challenges for the sake of their friends or not.

Story and character are probably where Amnesty is strongest; the one leg of the stool still standing. I’m curious about Griffin’s world and story (though less so since his revelation in the most recent TTAZZ that he has no idea where the story is going anymore). I like the boys’ characters (even though I think they lack the life and evolution of their Balance characters). I like Kepler and its inhabitants (even if I desperately miss the variety and imagination of the Balance settings and NPCs). But those things without play does not feel like TAZ. Starting at the tone of the Suffering Game arc and trying to sustain it, instead of allowing for an organic range of tones does not feel like TAZ either. What it feels like, is an urban fantasy procedural like those MOTW is based on, rather than a family playing a game together.

**A Few Side Notes on the Boys’ Expressed D&D Concerns**

On Griffin's demigod concern: they can just not level up two at a time. Or mete out magic items more slowly. Or don't let Travis min/max beyond all reason, etc. They can create any balance they want, any number of ways. Griffin did a great job trimming D&D to D&D-lite in other areas; no reason he can’t just nerf some stuff in this one, if he wanted to.

On Justin's rule-fetishism concern: I can’t speak for anyone but me, but my interest in the rules was never in whether they followed them or which ones they ignored. My interest was in the four of them negotiating what the game was together – just like real D&D tables do all the time. Deciding together what to keep, what to ignore, what to modify, what matters, etc.

On Justin and Clint's spell exhaustion concern: there are more than a dozen other classes with a wide range of abilities no one on the show has yet used (including several other types of magic users). They've only scratched the surface of the range of stories they could tell and the range of characters they could create with the range of classes and races and abilities available, if they wanted to.

On the setting and tone concern: D&D also has dozens of other campaign settings available besides classic fantasy Faerun. There are steam punk settings, gothic horror settings (imagine Griffin’s Dracula in Ravenloft), jungle settings, pirate settings, future fantasy settings, spacefaring settings, and more. Do you know how wild Sigil is? There is no genre or tone they couldn’t do in a D&D campaign, if they wanted to.

""**The Best Game Ever""**

I’ll also just note in closing that, in at least three different episodes of Balance, Griffin sincerely exclaims some version of “D&D is a great game!” or “D&D is the best game ever!” I don’t recall ever hearing anything similar get exclaimed about MOTW by any of them during the Amnesty episodes.

Fun is contagious and undeniable. Fun play is what I think has always defined the McElroy brand, across podcasts. Fun is what I no longer often feel, and play is what I miss most, when I listen to new Amnesty episodes now. Fun and play (and D&D) are what I dearly hope come back in whatever they do after Amnesty.  Please, play with us in this space again.",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 20:36:23

We’re doing a project in science about heredity, and of course... it *had* to be a group project

R never really did his work, and, in general he was an ass.

We had 3 members, Me, Another person who actually worked (H) , and our victim in this story, R.

R didn’t do *any* work on the project, at all. H did his slides, I did mine, and since R didn’t do his, I did it for him

Now we had to all do our own slides, and were graded on them. Meaning, I just have him a grade... or did I?

Let’s set the scene, it’s Science class, and we began to work on our projects again

R: Hey, OP, can you submit this for me?
Me: OK 

I didn’t submit it.

Later on, he asks

R: Hey OP, did you submit it
Me: *Yyy*es
R: Ok. Cool

My teacher had mentioned that if you don’t submit the project at the end of the period, it’s a 0, unless you speak to her about it.

R had been stupid that period and my teacher was kind of annoyed by him. *Just imagine how annoyed she’ll be when she sees he didn’t submit it*

TL;DR (even though it’s short) Person in group project doesn’t do his part, asks me to submit his work, and I don’t.

Edit: For clarification: he came up to me with *his* school iPad and told me to submit the slides from there, “this” being the group slides we all had access to and edited (though he did not)",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 14:21:00

&#x200B;

I received my paycheck, and like every sane person would do, I decided to go to a store to buy shit. So, I bought some junk food, nothing really expensive. And I bought a bottle of wine, a tasty but cheap one. So I go to the cashier and there was a woman, in her 40's. She was buying just toilet paper and baby powder. But when she goes to pay, she didn't had enough money. Seeing that the two products were necessary (We all know the pain. No toilet paper = Cry in the shower), I offered to pay. She looked at me with star in her eyes, and told me that she was really grateful. But then... CB attacks.

&#x200B;

No, not another person. SHE IS THE CB \*TAN TAN TAAAAAAN\*

&#x200B;

She asked me if she could get one more thing. Looking at her, seeing what she was buying I told her yes. She probably would want something urgent, because she was asking a total strange to buy right?

&#x200B;

Wrong. She come over, with one of the most expensive bottles of wine in the shop (Like, 60 bucks). I looked her shocked, but body block her. Conversation goes. C: Cashier. Me: An unicorn. CB: Cow Buster.

&#x200B;

Me: Excuse me ma'am, but I will not pay for that.

CB: But you told me It was okay!

Me: I know that I said it's okay to buy another thing, but I never thought you would try to buy a bottle of wine.

CB: But you're buying one too. I really want one.- At that moment I was in a good mood. So I just told her:

Me: I can buy you a bottle -She literally lit up like a fucking christmas tree- But I can't buy that one, it's really expensive.

CB: But I don't like cheap wine- She looked at the bottle in my hand and fake trembled like she was disgusted by it.

C: Ma'am, sir, you are both holding the line.- I looked, and really, we were.

Me: Lady, it's your choice, or a cheaper bottle, or no wine.-She just scoffed at me.

CB: Can't you understand? I. DON'T. LIKE. CHEAP. WINE. -She told me like I was slow in understanding.

I just looked at the cashier. I passed my things, CB probably thought I was gonna pass hers too. Nope, I payed mine, and moved.

CB: Aren't you gonna pay?-She yelled. I just ignored her. Never abuse the goodwill of others.

&#x200B;

Moral of the story: Cheap wine is the best, but Cows can't really hold her liquor because they don't have hands.

They wanted to make me the African Queen,619,b8pyd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/b8pyd2/they_wanted_to_make_me_the_african_queen/,40,1554244352.0," 

This happened 6 or so years ago now, when I was 16 years old. I didn't even realize how unnerving this all was until recently.

When I was 15-16 years old, I went through a phase where I would constantly get hair extensions put in. I had a favourite salon that I always went to, the two ladies were lovely and would always compliment me on my appearance, stuff like ""you are so pretty girl, do you have a boyfriend? Cannot believe you are only 15"" in which I felt absolutely flattered.

However, after my 6th or 7th appointment, they started asking more about why I was single and if I was interested in having a boyfriend and I would always reply with the whole ""yes when the *right* one comes along\*""\* spill.

During an appointment, they started chatting about me being single... again. This time one of the ladies started talking about her brother, she said that he lives in Africa but he would absolutely love me and that I should meet him one day. I asked her how old he was and she said he was in his early twenties - I was *fourteen.* Due to the age gap and the fact my older brother would have *killed* me for even talking to a guy in the year above me, I politely told her that I was NOT interested in meeting her brother, but thanks for the offer.

She got visibly upset and said ""WHYYYY? Come on, he will look after you! Let him take you back to Africa and he will make you the African Queen.""

I just shook it off because they were always so nice and I just assumed they were joking around.

I remember telling a few friends about it and having a laugh, they said I should have taken the offer... it was soon forgotten.

Fast forward **TWO YEARS** and I was around 17 years old at this point and had just gotten my drivers license. It had been awhile since I had hair extensions put in and I thought that I would treat myself to change up my look and of course, see my old stylists for a catch up! I went to the salon, it went smoothly, I went from short hair to long hair in a matter of two hours and I was on my way. Before I left one of the ladies asked if I wanted to come back tomorrow to try out their new hair oil serum for FREE, so I was like YES! Nothing is free in this life, sadly I was like a moth to a bright light.

I went in the next day, super keen for this oil because my real hair was super damaged. When I arrived there was a man in the salon too, I assumed it was their friend? I didn't think too much about it and sat down to get my free serum. The whole time this man was just staring at me, and when I say staring, I mean STARING. He did not say a word the entire time but just STARED and did a strange giggle every time I said something. His vibes were not sitting well with me.

After they finished I just wanted to leave, so I gathered up my things, said thank you very much, good day ladies and *sir*.

One of them stopped me on my way out and said ""this is my brother I was telling you about"" *oh -* ""let him walk you to your car""

Unfortunately my car was parked literally 10 minutes away and I did not want this stranger walking with me for 10 minutes, so I politely declined. they kept insisting in which I kept declining, I said NO, no no NoNo NO NO thank YOU I do not need NOR want your brother to walk me to my car thank yOU for offering and for free oil b y e.

I left the salon and started walking, however I was not alone. The BROTHER was walking 2 meters behind me, and where the salon was located was practically like an alley way, leading into a carpark, leading into back streets. I turned around and told him again that I really did not need him to walk me to my car, I was VERY capable thank you b y e.

His reply was short and to the point ""No I come with you."" um? No worries.

So I walked briskly all the way to where my car was and not a word was said, he just walked 2 meters behind me, sometimes he caught up and would walk next to me. This went on for 10 minutes... I felt so terribly awkward and uncomfortable and scared as it was getting dark and I could not see anyone else.

When I was near my car I had enough of this grown ass man, so I turned around and said ""I do not NEED you to follow me anymore thank YOU for walking with me, my car is in this car park **B Y E**""

He finally started talking...

""Where is your boyfriend?"" and me being an incredibly smart woman at age 17 said ""I don't have a boyfriend"" *dumb.*

What he said and did next, I will never forget, there was an elevator right where we were standing, that went to the upper level car park. He summoned the elevator which I thought was strange? When it reached us, he looked me straight in the eye and said ""you need to come home with me, where I will make you my African Queen"" and grabbed my arm and started trying to DRAG me into the elevator. Obviously I started screaming and fight-mode kicked in, he was a lot stronger than me as he was a male in his late twenties and I was this small little 17 year old with a fresh weave. But boy you best believe ya girl can scream.

My heart was in my throat, it felt like I was in a movie and I genuinely started bracing for assault in this elevator.

An amazing gentleman who must have been in the car park somewhere heard me and ran over, which made the salon ladies brother let go of me and absolutely leg it (run away very quickly).

Thank you to the kind man who saved me that day, I do not know what would have happened in that elevator...

So to the salon ladies and their brother, let's never meet again and for the 100th time, thank you but NO I do not want to be the African Queen.",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 17:32:32

I am female, 30 years old, 5’3 and have always struggled with my weight since puberty hit me like a ton of bricks at just ~12 years old. Since then, my weight has gone through drastic changes (going both ways, losing and gaining, but have always been overweight since) I feel a lot of fluctuations are a mix of binge eating, depression, prescriptions such as anti-depressants, dexedrine (adhd medication) and I believe a small part of it is genetics. I have been taking small steps to take charge and to own up to my bad habits, I walk to work more often, eat less carbs, and include more raw veggies into my meals. I know I’m  overweight, it’s more than obvious, but I still feel at least I have a pretty face. I have a love/hate relationship with my body. Some days I feel great, I tell myself ‘who doesn’t love a cheerful, funny, bubbly, chubby woman!? other days I feel like I’m just a gigantic piece of shit that nobody could ever love or want. It really depends on the day.. If there is anyone that can relate, I would be happy to hear your story and the  progress you have made. My ideal body weight is ~140-160 lbs. I feel like that would be perfect for me. Thanks for listening, looking forward to hearing what struggles/successes you have experienced ❤️

Why Not?,1048,b8oldl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b8oldl/why_not/,50,1554237545.0,"When I was six years old, my parents began locking me in the cupboard below the sink.  It was not punishment for anything I had done.  There was no behavior that needed correcting. They just one day decided to see what would happen if you locked a young boy in a small space.

I pounded my tiny fists against the doors.  I cried, I peed.  I put my eye against the keyhole and watched as they went about their business, sans me.  Finally, I started to scream.  “Why?  Why are you doing this?”

My mother slowly walked toward the cupboard, knelt down so her eye was at the keyhole, and said simply, “Why not?”

They did this for many years.  There was never any warning.  I would be eating breakfast, anticipating the walk to school, when suddenly one of them would grab me by the arm and haul me into the cupboard.  I fought at first, but it was pointless.  They were bigger than me.  My resistance did nothing.

Sometimes it was thirty minutes.  Other times, I could be inside for half a day.  I don’t know if they forgot about me or had some sick pleasure in making me wait.  The longest I was ever inside was an entire weekend.  They went out of town.  When they came back I was nearly dead.  It didn’t seem to bother them at all.

As I grew older it became more and more uncomfortable in the small cupboard.  The smell of cleaning supplies would make me lightheaded.  The mold and everyday decay would stick to my clothes and hair.  It was an odd prison.  Dark, but quiet.  The only light came in through the keyhole, which I watched like a sentry.  

To be honest, I got used to it.  It became normal.  Almost comforting.  I was able to watch my family as if I was not one of them.  I could clearly see the kitchen table, where my mother would sort the mail.  A little further on I could see the front door and a bit of the sofa.  My father came in and out, the same hat everyday.  I began to know them intimately.  Perhaps they wanted me to disappear.  But by locking me inside they made me even more real.

Abruptly one day they stopped.  Maybe it was because I was too big, or maybe because they had lost interest.  But I went a full week without a session in the cupboard.  I was twelve.  After two weeks I came to my father.  “Why aren’t you putting me in the cupboard anymore?”

He didn’t look up from his coffee.  “Why not?”

I write this only to explain how I became a voyeur.  You see, after six or so years of being confined to a cage, you cannot help but find something to love about it.  I knew what it was like to be truly alone.  Yet a large part of me yearned for the outside world.  It was a contradiction - I wanted to be confined free at the same time.  So confinement became my freedom.

I hid in every space I could fit, as long as it had a hole to see out of.  I stopped going to school.  I wore clothing that covered me up completely except for my eyes.  I wanted to see, not be seen.  As usual, my family did not notice.  I was a prop to walk around.  

Finding new places to hide in the house was crucial.  I turned to closets, behind doors, under beds.  No one went looking for me.  My favorite spot was a shelf in my parents’ room.  It was up high and had a small door to close.  I fit inside even as a seventeen year old.  My knees to my chest, I would stay up there all day until they fell asleep.  I was an owl.  Silent.  Perched.

Years passed slowly inside small spaces.  One day I was up on the shelf, enjoying being enclosed.  My mother walked into the bedroom.  I remember she wore plain blue jeans and a white blouse.  My father followed her in the same hat he wore everyday.  Neither displayed any specific emotion.  

I noticed the gun in my father’s hand.  It wasn’t strange, he carried guns often.  But without warning he lifted it and fired at my mother.  She turned around, bored.  He had missed.

She held her hand out and he gave the gun to her.  I was pressed as close I could get to the small opening.  I could hear my heart beating in my ears.  I knew my parents were strange, but nothing like this.

My mother inspected the gun for a moment before pointing it at my father.  Her shot found its mark in his forehead.  He fell back like a bowling pin.  I let out a small yelp.  She looked up at me, blank-faced.  Quietly, I slipped out of the shelf and stood in front of her, shaking.

“Why did you shoot him?” I asked, choking back fear.

Her words came as no surprise to me.  “Why not?”  She held the gun out, dangling it from her pointer finger.  Terrified I held up my hands and she dropped it onto my open palms.

“I can’t,” I whispered.

“Why not?” I looked at her.  There was no life behind her eyes.  No love, no sympathy.

I raised the gun.  When I pulled the trigger my entire body exploded with the kickback.  I stumbled onto the bed, unsure if I had even hit her.  

My mother remained standing for a moment, a hole where her left eye had been.  Then like a doll she crumpled to the floor.  She and my father bled a dark black fluid onto the carpet.

I thought about hiding in my usual spots, but it didn’t feel right.  The whole point was to observe.  I couldn’t watch what was not living.  So I gathered up some things, clothes, and my parents’ money.  I knew I had to find new spots in other people’s homes.  I took the gun too...maybe as a momento.

As I opened the front door I heard noises from the bedroom.  It was my parents, rising from their deathbeds.  But I couldn’t look back, even if their voices begged me to return.  They said they were finally free.  They would love me now.  But I shut the door to their wails.  This would be a new chapter for me.

A brand new life.

Because, [why not?](https://www.facebook.com/EZmisery)

After her drink was made the bartender almost instantly poured it out and made another; I was very confused but didnt question it. Just thought he might have forgot the alcohol or something. 

Fast forward to when we got home and I asked what happend with the drink:

She said that there was a creepy guy who was standing around the bar a bit. He was standing next to her and was nudging her with his elbow while the bartender was making her drink. He made my girlfriends drink first and then turned around to get a beer from the tap for me. Around this time a friend I hadn't seen in awhile came up to talk to me and I missed those events. Turns out the reason he poured it out was because he turned away from her drink and it was alone on the bar for a second. 

Even if I did see him leave the drink alone I wouldn't have thought twice about it. So shout out to the dude who was bartending for being vigilant about making sure people's drinks are safe and turning a potentially dangerous situation into a learning one for me.

Bartender left a drink unattended for a second, dumped it and made a new one",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 16:58:07

Entitled Parents threaten to call CPS and sue daycare for having an autistic child.,1139,b8q4u9,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/b8q4u9/entitled_parents_threaten_to_call_cps_and_sue/,65,1554245326.0,"This is a rather long one so bare with me. Obligatory ""I'm on mobile"" comment. Cross posted in r/entitledredditors

Cast: EM (entitled mom), ED (Entitled Dad), EB1 and EB2 (entitled brats 1 and 2), SB (sweet boy), M (Manager)

So before some of my health issues I worked in a few daycare centers as and Early childcare assistant. Working in childcare means you see your fair share of entitled parents but this couple took the cake.

It was the start of September and our daycare had a few openings for new students. I had been at this daycare for maybe a month and had gotten quite close to the group of 12 or so children, and I was excited to meet any new students we would be getting in. 

It was mid week when we were told a new family would be starting with us and would be bringing in 2 children. 

Enter the entitled family.

From the moment they came through the door it was evident that they were going to be a bit of a pain but you sometimes get difficult parents. EM walked in with a 'can I speak to your manager' hair cut. ED was trying to range EB1 and EB2.

EB1 was a 5 year old girl, she was well spoken and intependant but something about her seemed a bit off.

EB2 was 4 and well,  not to be mean but he was FAT. I'm not talking a bit pudgy,  I mean this was the biggest and roundest child I have ever laid eyes on. Now I'm far from a spring chicken myself, and were his size not relivant to this story I wouldn't even share it, because who am I to judge.

From the first few minutes watching this family settle in a few things became quite apparent. EB1 was mostly ignored by her family, and EB2 had EVERYTHING done for him.

The parents only stayed for an hour to let the kids settle in, then headed to work and I thought things would be normal, but oh no.

EB2 had apparently taken quite a liking to me, and was super clingy. It's nice to be liked but we do try to encourage children to play with eachother more than the teachers, with one exception, SB.

Now SB was the sweetest child I have ever had the pleasure of teaching. He was almost 4, loved Robert Munsch books and  firetrucks (which was amazing since we were 4 buildings down from a fire station, and another girl's dad was a firefighter). SB was also almost entirely nonverbal and had autism. This meant sometimes he had some difficulties with his interactions, but was overall very happy standing on a stool most of the day, watching the fire house and playing with his trucks.

Usually I worked with SB all day, since he had also taken a liking to me and for many toddlers on the spectrum having someone they are comfortable with really helps with their ability to follow instructions and join in with group activities.

EB2 did not like this one bit. He was constantly demanding the attention of not only me but of other staff members too, and when he felt he didn't get it he would cry.

Now I'm a a very compassionate person byt also a no nonsense teacher and they crying grew more tiring with the more obvious it was how spoiled EB2 was.

Not only did EB2 not know how to put on his velcro shoes, open his lunch box, or put on his coat at 3 years old (a feat most 4 year olds can manage with a bit of effort) he would demand help and when told ""I want to see you try first on your own and then I will help you"" he would have a fit, crying and throwing whatever he had.

The second day they came to daycare ED pulled me aside to inform me that EB1 had said a child had hit her. Of course I was surprised but it is a daycare and these things can happen. I appologized and told the ED we would keep and eye on her to make sure nothing happened again, though I did find it odd since she had spent most of the first day playing by herself as she had stated she likes her own space. 

We kept an eye on her all day and nothing happened. We were relieved. However EB2 had begun hitting many other children and trying to take their toys from them, only to throw more tantrums when told to wait his turn and not to hit. This was especially worrying because of his size, and that most children in our care were quite small for their age.

Again the next day ED comes in, this time with EM, claiming their daughter had been hit. I politely informed them that their daughter hadn't interacted with anyone except for one other newer girl and that we had been keeping a very close eye on her all day and had not witnessed any such event. 

EM grabbed EB1's arm and said ""show me who is the boy who hit you!""

EB1 points to SB. 

I tell the parents ""SB didn't even interact with EB1. I was with him all day.""

EM glares at me as says ""That autistic boy should be in a special school for other autistic children""

I am getting annoyed but trying to remain polite ""SB does just fine in this class and this is where his older brother came so he is comfortable here""

ED then cuts in ""that autistic boy traumatized our daughter. I don't want my children going somewhere unsafe""

I reiterated the fact that EB1 had not informed us of being hit by anyone, that we hadn't seen anything and that it most certainly wasn't SB who did it.

Then I dun goofed.

 I informed them that EB2 had actually hit several children. They both insisted that he was just stressed about the new environment. They gave a half assed ""remember gentle hands"" to EB2 and left.

Over the next week and a half there was a new issue every day. Anything from EB1 not getting to play with the doll she wanted, to EB2 not being lifted up to use the slide (he couldn't climb the ladder and was far to heavy to lift without possible injury). No matter what though every day came with the accusation the SB had in some way been violent towards one or both of their children. 

I had been careful to tell my manager who worked downstairs in the other classroom everything that had been happening when it was happening and my coworkers backed me up. My manager was a small but tough older woman with very little filter who was not afraid of conflict.

One morning she decided to stay in my classroom as the kids came in to see first hand what EM and ED were going to say.

ED says that EB1 (who has begun a habit of taking toys from kids when she wants them and lying constantly) said SB hit her and threw a truck at her and pulled her hair.

I once again say I had been with SB all day and none of that had happened, however once again EB2 had been quite violent with other children (all week I'd been telling them about his discretions).

ED then says that EB2 is only like that because he has seen SB hurting EB1 and is picking up bad behavior because he's never like this.

EM instantly started on her rant about how she was going to call CPS to have this child removed from the daycare and put in an 'autistic school'. M was quick to step in and tell her she had no right to do that and that he isn't her child. EM and ED kept going off about how 'the autistic boy' was a danger to other children and 'the autistic boy' needs special care.

M was getting clearly frustrated and said ""you need to stop calling him 'the autistic boy' his name is SB, and that is incredibly disrespectful."" 

EM said ""well he is autistic so I can call him what I want""

Then M said something that I didn't expect ""so would you be fine is everyone called EB2 'the fat boy' instead of his name?""

EM and ED saw red.

They grabbed their children and stormed out cussing about calling the police. A few days later M came to me and told me they had left the daycare but wanted all their money back for the month and wanted to sue as for additional trauma their children had experienced due to their time at the daycare. 

M had to go meet with them and the officials at the childcare licencing board to prove she didn't owe them anything. Luckily I had documented everything in a dated communication book the staff shared and myself and the other staff signed written statements basically saying their children were lying, violent, spoiled brats.

M also brought the contract with her they had signed and payed for stating they would be with us for a 3 Month trial period and including a clause that stated the center required a month's notice to leave.

EM and ED ended up having to pay for the 2 months left in their contract plus an additional month for no canceling with notice. 

I only stayed at the daycare another month,as I caught a very serious illness from a child and was off work for 3 months recovering, but the last I saw SB was doing wonderfully and starting to help read along with some of his favorite books.

I was 15 at the time, this dude was 19. Over the course of 2 years this cunt humiliates me, calls me names, questions my sexuality, etc.

Makes my life a living hell. My parents came to the school, and he stops. For 2 days. 3rd day in, he jumps me in the school yard, gives me a black eye and breaks my glasses, my friends who were with me managed to fend him off but the damage was done. 

Now instead of going to the teachers, I leave school and wait for him behind a dumpster nearby. As soon as he passes i broke my skateboard in his back and book it, cracked 2 of his ribs. School hears this and we both get sent to the principals office. I tell everything on him, including the skateboard part so that the prick has no shit on me.

School checks cameras, and sees him hit me. They called the cops and he is arrested for assault, and has to pay for my glasses. I got suspended for 2 weeks. 

Only saw him in the next year and he avoided me like the plague.

* **Hecarim, Nasus, Trundle, and Nautilus** are the four titans.

# Zombies vs. Slayers

Zombie apocalypse. You know what's up.

* **Brand** was a military scientist responsible for the development of a powerful virus. When his funding got cut, he tested the mutagen on himself, becoming patient zero.

* **Varus, Caitlyn, and Volibear** are soldiers.
* **Gragas** is a mysterious, questionably-human test subject from High Command's secretive R&D labs.

# Woad Tribe

* **Darius** is king of the Woad tribe. For a tribesman to be named king, they must remove the head of a hydra. Darius removed all nine.

# NOTES

A) Though they are officially designated separate universes, the following universes contain references to one another, which implies that they take place in the same world.

* Pulsefire + Everything *(While not exactly the same universe, it must be stated that Pulsefire time travelers have access to all other universes, officially combining all LoL AUs into a single multiverse.)*
* Event Horizon + Odyssey *(Odyssey Kayn's Rhaast is a servant of the Dark Star.)*
* K/DA + Pentakill *(Evelynn claims to take inspiration from Karthus. DJ Sona exists here as well, despite also being a member of Pentakill. Multiple talents!)*
* Star Guardian + Culinary Masters *(Pajama Guardian Soraka brought cinnamon rolls from Pantheon's Pastries to the slumber party. However, according to Pulsefire Ezreal, the show Culinary Masters exists in more than 50 universes.)*
* Winter Wonder + Sugar Rush *(Dark Candy Fiddlesticks seems to exist in both. Possibly a mistake.)*

B) I've chosen to omit a number of universes/sets due to the fact that they are extremely self-explanatory, or could hardly be called universes at all. (Example: Pool Party. It's a pool party. You get it.) I also opted not to include universes containing two or fewer skins, such as Thunder Lord. Additionally, a lack of official clarification has left the boundaries of some universes unclear, such as Lunar Revel and Bilgewater. To avoid speculation, I have omitted these as well. If you disagree with any of these omissions, I'd love to hear why.

C) While skins are officially listed by universe within the game client (you can find them under Collection > Skins > Set > Universe), the page is in desperate need of love and has not incorporated newly released skins in some time. (Riot pls hire me to fix that page.) I did a lot of digging for this post, so please let me know if I missed anything, and I will update as necessary.

Hope you enjoy.",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 19:34:40

Mueller Report: The 9 Things That Don't Make Sense About the Barr Letter,379,b8qu0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/b8qu0n/mueller_report_the_9_things_that_dont_make_sense/,12,1554249301.0,"Not sure if youtube videos can be posted here, if they cant then this can be removed. But the youtube channel LegalEagle provided an excellent summary of the things which don't make sense about the Barr Letter from an attorneys perspective. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3qjH7pFq_0

This is a summary by Devin from https://www.legaleagleprep.com/, an experienced lawyer who graduated from Stanford and who worked for 10 years in some of the big law firms. He runs a youtube channel which goes through current legal events such as the Mueller investigation as well as courthouse scenes from movies and TV series. 

The questions he asks in the course of the video are:

1. Why does the Barr letter only cover two of the three facets of the Mueller investigation? 
2. What does Barr mean when he says that the Mueller Report ""did not establish"" a conspiracy with the Russians. 
3. Why does Barr suggest there can be no obstruction of justice when there isn't a conviction for an underlying crime?
4. Why does Barr think that there was no crime? 
5. Why didn't Mueller decide the obstruction issue? 
6. Why did Barr weight in on the obstruction issue?
7. Who's legal conclusion are these and are there more we haven't seen? 
8. Why did Barr quote ""The Mueller Report does not exonerate the President""?
9. Why was there a decision made not to prosecute for obstruction of justice without interviewing the President?

With this legislation, based upon the standards of Bernie Sanders, millions of people would be able to access healthcare services, improving and saving the lives of people who otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford them. Implementing “Medicare for All” would be the most ambitious domestic project that our country has attempted in decades. And because of the monumental nature of the feat (in relation to contemporary American political history), great caution should be taken in the process of determining the administrational and infrastructural needs of the bill. Dealing with people’s lives calls for strict precision in the creation of policy, and the progressives are **done** if this attempt at universal healthcare fails. Not only that, but the wording should legally air-tight. Trump’s judges will outlive him, and they will do anything they can to undermine Medicare. 

But this daunting feat before us offers us a chance to create the most modern healthcare system in the world. We could lead the world in healthcare and we could set a new global standard for quality care. Our situation is full of potential; we can get this done.

I came out as bi to the first person ever yesterday. She's my roommate/best friend and I've had a low key crush on her since November. I've been in a hetero relationship for almost 5 years, but have been questioning since long before that, and only really began serious questioning/coming to terms once I got to college. The idea of coming out to my partner scares me beyond belief for a mountain of reasons that I don't feel like getting into. The main reason is I know my current partner would not be ok with it and his jealousy of my guy friends would extend to my female friends. I'm also scared of the ""you're not that gay"" types of responses.

&#x200B;

Idk what got into me yesterday, but for some reason I became very overwhelmed with this. It's happened a lot in the past, put has really gotten worse this academic year. She was sitting at my desk, I in my bed, and we were already having a kind of ""deep"" conversation about another topic. It was an almost out of body experience. I did not plan on sharing this at all. I've only known her for 7 months, but we've gotten very close very fast. I kind of abruptly changed topics and asked ""If I tell you something, can you promise to keep it between us? Like I've never told anyone, not even \[insert name of other best friend of 5 years who happens to be pan\]."" she said yes, I told her and started crying. Her response ""That is beautiful, congratulations."" 

&#x200B;

That response is something I will never forget. I have been playing the whole thing all day. This is the first of many coming out conversations I will have that I'm still not yet ready for. I knew she wouldn't care, but I'm glad that that was my first coming out response. Upon telling her and continuing to talk about it all evening, I have found out shes questioning too, which ya know, only makes me happier.",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:37:21

Its a 3-part move, requires charging during each move for max damage. For low-health trash such as skeleton warriors and guitar hero a few quick hits will do the job. Its the Yokai elites, Onyudo / Raven Tengu / Namahage / Kusamofo / Magatsu, that i need Moonlit's mad damage for but i can never reach the 3rd move without dying unless i do some bait and punish to deplete their ki but i dont need Moonlit by then since they are probably dead in less than 3 hits away.

I am probably doing it wrong but how can i do it better? Is it pretty pointless if i do uncharged Moonlits? Should i not bother if i am unable to land the full combo since only the 3rd move matters as that hits the hardest? It takes like 3 - 4 secs to complete the entire move, likely to trade damage with Yokais while at it, how are people still standing?

Any ideas for historic or interesting things? I wanted to make her take a picture with all the pegasus statues, but I don’t think there is a map of them anywhere. I can’t do the same with the BIG signs because there’s only two.

"[OC] Using Data from the 2009-2010 season (When Curry Entered the League) to 2018-2019 season each NBA team will attempt 50 three pointers per game by 2031, suggesting that each NBA game will have 100 3 pointers attempted.",1,b8tkeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b8tkeg/oc_using_data_from_the_20092010_season_when_curry/,0,1554266238.0,"Of course, curry will likely drop off by then but he was the one to revolutionize the 3 ball but other players \*cough\* Harden are continuing to grow the popularity of the three pointer, unfortunately, it's here to stay for awhile.

This is also crazy to think about since if the 3P% remains around 35% as it has stayed for the 21st century, each team is scoring 52.5 points off of 3 pointers alone.

For a little bit of context we went from 13.7 in 1999-2000 season to 31.4 in the 2018-2019 season. It was always slightly increasing every year, until 2011 (18.4), arguably when Steph started to show his signature game. That shows how much more popular the three ball has become after Steph has entered the league compared to the rate of increase before he was drafted. The trendline equation for 1999-2000 -- 2018-2019 season is 0.813x+10.8 while it changes to 1.56x+14.5, in terms of statistics the slope (0.813 compared to 1.56) represents the rate of increase per year comparing the increase over the last 20 seasons compared to the 10 most recent seasons. The trendline equation, plugging in x using x as the pattern of the season it represents should give you the expected value of 3PA per team \*assuming\* that the average rate of increase remains the same as the timeframe included in the graph.

&#x200B;

The reason I use 1-X as my X variables is that using 1999-20xx is because the latter method includes the numbers 0-1999 as a part of the trend of increase.  It does make it more confusing to read but the title and the labels should help you understand it.

&#x200B;

The difference that Curry made is significant sing using Data from the 1999-2000 season to 2018-2019 suggest it will take until 2047 until each NBA team will attempt 50 three per game compared to 2030.

Need advice.....no one to talk to,1,b8tke4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b8tke4/need_adviceno_one_to_talk_to/,0,1554266236.0,"Sorry need to vent and advice! I apologize in advance this is my first time posting anything on Reddit.

I’ve been in relationship with my bf for a few years (6). Just to give a little background info. We started dating while I was in College. It was great at first and then issues/ obstacles ex. Ex GF, insecurities family related matters and what not. I mean nothing and no one is perfect in life I get.

Anyways before I dated him I had these group of friends someone were in serious relationships and some were not. We would always hangout, drinks and clubs. When we got together I started to hangout less and less with them. You know that first dating sensation where you guys just want to spend all the time together. It then it got to a point where I would get invited and be asked to go out. Being the person that I am I would make sure it was okay with him prior to making plans. It always seemed an issue like your girlfriends act like their single, they drink a lot and they spend a lot of money when you guys go out etc.....it got to a point where I stopped hanging out it always caused a fight between us. My college year ended and all my friends moved back to their hometown. I stopped hanging out with anyone and it’s just been him and I.

We’ve talked about getting married within our first year of dating. I was okay with it, but he never proposed. Something in life always came up whether it was career opportunities, moving states, and death within out families. That’s over the course of years together. Which I understand and now recently we’ve been talking more about marriage and buying a home.

I can’t help, but feel like I’m being trapped. I moved with him to a whole new state for his career (grad school). I work two jobs and have maybe 2 friends that I’ve made at work. As I mentioned before i thought my old friends were an issue to hangout. Now recently it still seems to bother him. I make my own money and pay the bills at home. When I ask to hangout he gets upset and causes a fight. The main reason is that my friends drink too much and they spend alot. That they are terrible friends. So I again I stop. Money seems to be an issue or the excuse. 

Can I still be in a relationship and be independent? I feel like i lost a big part of myself dating him. I’m scared to think what will happen when we actually get married.

Is it wrong of me to wanting to be by myself sometimes without him there? We’ve basically been attached at the hip since we’ve dated. I think that’s my fault partially for allowing it. I need space and time for myself. I just don’t know how to tell him without hurting his feelings and causing a fight. I love him, but I feel like I’m trapped....",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:37:16

Looking For Titration Equipment Suggestions and Guidance,1,b8tkdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/b8tkdj/looking_for_titration_equipment_suggestions_and/,0,1554266233.0,"Hello everyone! I am getting into chemistry and I am looking to set up a titration lab.

Firstly, I am looking at a set on amazon that includes a graduated funnel, a glass funnel, a filter flask and an aluminum clamp. This is the link - [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072F3QXLS/ref=ox\_sc\_act\_title\_1?smid=A20OTSA3U81O6H&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072F3QXLS/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A20OTSA3U81O6H&psc=1)

The components of this kit appear to be well-made. A flask of 1000ml can surely work, though a bit more volume could be useful. The upper part of the apparatus at which the reagent is to be added could be larger. Anywhere of a volume from 100ml-1000ml would be sufficient in the upper portion.

Next, I am aiming to purchase a fume hood  to perform titrations in - preferably one that can be moved from time to time; one not-so-permanent. One possibility I saw was this hood - [https://labgenome.com/smart321gl-erlab-captair-smart-ductless-fume-hoods-321-smart-glass-worksurface-each-of-1/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwkIzlBRDzARIsABgXqV9Ck2aOxqEoKiqGxRDHEx31A8GaJfQkN39Tge6Ke8WJGAKgYUW5uEcaAviKEALw\_wcB](https://labgenome.com/smart321gl-erlab-captair-smart-ductless-fume-hoods-321-smart-glass-worksurface-each-of-1/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwkIzlBRDzARIsABgXqV9Ck2aOxqEoKiqGxRDHEx31A8GaJfQkN39Tge6Ke8WJGAKgYUW5uEcaAviKEALw_wcB)

Additionally, I need the following:

Filters that will prevent any solids from passing through

A hot plate that I can adjust the temperature on *roughly* between 100-500 degrees F (38-260 C), ideally with precision around 200-300 to the nearest degree

A vacuum source to connect to the funnel (any source of a vacuum would be fine)

Proper vacuum tubing that would fit my potential kit from amazon *OR* any alternative suggestions

Any additional components that I am forgetting or unaware of as well can be tacked on

&#x200B;

I always will lean towards more options with more volume. I don't necessarily have a budget, though I was aiming to keep the cost under $1000 if possible. I really need general knowledge here as well as where to buy the equipment. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

&#x200B;

Six practical writing tips I wish I knew a decade ago...,1,b8tkcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/b8tkcj/six_practical_writing_tips_i_wish_i_knew_a_decade/,0,1554266228.0,"After writing seven or so full-length books, multiple short stories, and speaking with fellow authors, I've come up what I believe is a definitive list of things I wish I knew when I first started writing...

1. Show, don't tell: I know we've all heard this a million times, but he's a better explanation of what this means; Avoid exposition if it can be written about actively. Don't describe how the 'so and so' people do this because of x,y,z, or how this specific 'character' is intelligent because of 'this.'
Write the character actively making intelligent decisions or have 'so and so' people doing said thing, and let readers make their own assumptions. Not everything has to be explained.

2. Avoid Exposition: This kind of ties into show don't tell, but in a different context. First off, exposition in itself is not a 'bad' thing. It can be used to fill in gaps, and explain specific events, but it should never be relied on. Why? It slows down pacing, can have detrimental effects on the plot, and can take away from the reader's engagement. It is far better to give information piecemeal in the relevant context of the plot rather than dumping it all once. If you find yourself using a lot of exposition, check to make sure your not filling in plot holes or padding.

3. Write an outline, even if you don't use it: Why would I recommend writing an outline? Well, it can firmly establish plot points and ideas, give you an idea of where to start and end the manuscript, and help keep you on track to finish your novel. Even if you write the outline, and never use it, it can give you an idea of where you are in the story. 

As a matter of fact, I don't recommend sticking strictly to a outline even if you are 100% in love with every part of it. As you write a novel or manuscript, you may reach a point where you feel as though the character or situation would happen differently than what you originally planned. That's OK. Let that organically lead you to the next part of the story. Tie it back into your original planned ending, or make a new one. Just keep your goalposts in mind.

4. Progress, Progress, Progress: Don't stop writing. You see that grammatical error that you have to fix, the sentence that reads weird, that word that doesn't fit, that odd characterization. Don't worry. Progress first, fix later. Get your whole story down on paper (or screen), and then sweat the details. Don't go back too far and reread chapters, because you'll began to fall into this trap. The temptation to fix things will began to put you in a near inescapable doldrums, that will find you stuck on the same 3-4 chapters for the next few months. Don't worry; Progress.

5. Sweat the characters before you write your first word: Do you know what your protagonist likes to eat? How she combs her hair? What kinda of toothbrush he prefers? What would he do if he was in a liquor store being robbed? What would she do if she found out her best friend had been cheating with her boyfriend? If he had suddenly been asked to sing a duet in front of a crowd? Would he or wouldn't he? You may ask yourself how any of these questions would affect the plot, but your missing the point.

The more detailed you make your characters, the easier it will be to write and finish your manuscript. Plain and simple. I find that a scene, plot point or chapter will almost magically write itself if your character's 'characterization' is strong enough. You'll know what she'll say or he'll say before you even start writing dialogue, how they'll react to a given situation, or even what they are thinking during an event. The more detailed you make your characters, the more real and relatable they will be to the reader.

6. Take your time: I was so excited that the first time I finished a manuscript that I proofread it in less than a week, and sent it off to family and friends.  This was a horrible, horrible mistake. Do not do this.
After you finish your manuscript, take a break. It could be a couple weeks, a few months or even a year. Create a proof copy if you want. Then read your book in it's entirety. 
The first thing you'll probably want to do is throw it in a dumpster fire as you read it. It's horrible. You'll see plot holes you could drive a truck through, glaring grammar issues, and plot contrivances that you never imagined could be so terrible. You probably hate it, and now you feel like giving up. Don't.
Now you get to slowly massage all the lumps, wrinkles and warts that fill your novel into beautiful and smooth passages. It will take time. It will take patience, but in the end you will have something that you can truly be proud of, for the most part.
And for those of you who love your rough draft, you need serious (clinical?) help. Find someone who you feel can judge your manuscript objectively (preferably an editor), and prepare to take some scathing and demoralizing criticism.
If they have little to nothing bad to say, find someone else. If that person has nothing bad to say, congratulations on writing something decent, and the rest of us will hate you for it.

There are many, many more things I could exposit upon, but if you learn nothing else, learn this: Just write and let the story do the rest.",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:37:08

Like Miller saved your ass then went back to get the kid and killed nosalises and the giant worms (with the kid on his back).

2. Metro 4 has got to be about returning to the Moscow Metro or something, what do y'all think?

3. Do you think the DLC should be about building up the colony and/or the side missions your comrades went on?

4. Now that you are the commander, do you think they will let Artyom make actual decisions? Perhaps a much more branching ending to the DLCs or even Metro 4.

Today, just for a thought experiment, I thought about what it'd be like to be a woman in my class, what IoIs would I give, how would I react to the attention I got. What would be my sexual strategy. And after 2 seconds I just couldn't believe that I wouldn't fuck everything that I saw if I could. I'd want to fuck everything. Then 2 seconds later I realised that's just the most male perspective. I just want to fuck everything, almost all the time. How do women a) not want to do that b) navigate that world where they just constantly are looked at to be fucked and c) how do women not do that

Rotation on a object being reset,1,b8tkcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/b8tkcf/rotation_on_a_object_being_reset/,0,1554266228.0,"***INTRO TO THE PROBLEM:***

Hello! I am relatively good at programming however rotations have always been something I had to kinda experiment with and hope that whatever new changes I make work. After trying to work out how to open doors feel like they do in amnesia (If you are not well versed in what that is, basically you drag open a door rather then use a animation to open doors) I have not had any luck doing it alone. So I went and copied someone else's code (It was established that he/she was okay with it) which was posted here:

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37129162/open-a-door-front-and-back-in-unity3d-similar-to-amnesia](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37129162/open-a-door-front-and-back-in-unity3d-similar-to-amnesia) 

&#x200B;

I would like to know why the problem below is happening as well as how to fix it so I can learn more about how unity applies rotations.  That and if this implementation is perhaps too crude/inelegant/simple and I should be looking at the problem in a different way? If there are any good sources that work with the current version of unity I would love to see them too. 

&#x200B;

**THE PROBLEM:**

When the door is interacted by one side after interacting with the other side it will always be reset to its original rotation, so if I open the door from the front, go in and try to close it it will reset completely. The same can be said when going through from the back and closing it on the front door side.  (*Visual aid at end of post*)

&#x200B;

I have edited the original script slightly (Plan on doing more with it in the future) But the fundamentals of how it works are relatively the same if not exactly the same. I have tried a lot of other implementations but so far this script is the closest to the result I want (Others mostly either simply don't work or just don't have the same feel)

The Physical Mesh is the ""Door 1""

The parent of the mesh is a empty plain axis coordinate imported from blender, while the front and backdoor game objects are just empty game objects made in Unity. 

I uploaded a visualisation of the issue 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFdsb-ahwW8&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFdsb-ahwW8&feature=youtu.be) 

&#x200B;

**Things I have tried:**

\- Creating a variable to save the current rotation then adding that current rotation to the yRotvalue (Unsure if I did it correctly)

\- Putting on a rigidbody, locking/unlocking every combination of position/rotation 

\- Using pure Unity objects to recreate the door (So the Door Hinge is a empty gameobject rather then an imported empty plain axes and using cubes instead of the imported door. Made no difference to the problem)

\- Removing all parents to the door hinge

USC vs Warwick Economics,1,b8tka0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b8tka0/usc_vs_warwick_economics/,0,1554266215.0,"I am international student who has received offers from universities across US, UK and Canada and I have narrowed down my top 2 choices to Warwick University in the UK and University of Southern California in the US:-

Course: Economics/Mathematics Joint major at USC and Economics at Warwick

Cost: Not the main deciding factor but USC will be around double the cost of Warwick. My father is lucky enough to be able to afford but still would not want to waste money if not worth.

Location: USC in LA vs Warwick near the small town of Coventry

Pros and cons:-

Warwick pros- ranked number 3 in the UK for economics, cheaper, Investment banking target university 

Warwick cons-  Worse weather, difficult to get a work permit in the UK for international students vs the US, I want to do a PHD in Economics in the US (hopefully T20) so lesser recognised in the US?

USC pros: High ranking in the US so more recognised for my PHD in the US??, better weather, easier to get work permit in the US vs UK, can minor in public policy which is my interest area (more flexible than the UK)

USC cons: More expensive, Economics not their strongest major?? 

So to sum up I want to attend grad school/PHD after my undergrad preferably in fields related to Economics and public policy. 

I am not biased towards any of the two and would love to hear unbiased and factual opinions. Please be honest as to which of the two would be a better choice for economics (Warwick) and Economics/Mathematics joint major (USC).

I’m not saying I’m like... psycho 
I’m just wondering why I don’t feel sad or sorry

I’m on meds for anxiety and depression atm but I don’t think it’s the cause, because I was like this way before taking them...
Back in 2014 was the last time I remember crying, smiling, laughing because it was the time I lost my brother to murder. And after that, I lost every feeling of emotion in me.
I recently lost 2 close cousins I grew up with to suicide, and I lost an uncle to a drug overdose, and my grandma to natural causes (old age and cancer) 
And I didn’t even shed a single tear at their funeral, I didn’t hug anyone, I didn’t comfort anybody at all. All I did was watch and not feel sad. I still don’t feel anything, I just came here for my curiosity. ",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:36:44

To tell you in person.

You tell me to be honest,

So I thought it would be fine,

But you scream and lash out,

With so much emotion!

At first I can hear,

But then I don't,

Your words start to blur,

Then go    m o n o t o n e,

I'm so used to this,

That i'm numbing inside,

I dread that soon I will have no emotion.

You tell me to go away,

And my throat swells up,

Then I go upstairs,

With guilt and aghast,

This isn't the first time,

And won't be the last.

I'm looking for info/advice... There was an incident today with my chinchilla. He got out of his cage somehow while I was at work. I have two German shepherds also at home. The chinchilla has its own seperate room and the dogs are not allowed access without my being there. We also keep a gate up so the dogs cant even try to get in while we are not home. This has worked for a long time, but i did not anticipate the chinchilla getting out of his cage. When I got home the chin was in his cage but I noticed fur on the floor in some spots and upong examiming the chinchilla I noticed his fur was spiky as if had been wet..there were also patches of fur missing but everything else looked fine and I could find no broken bones. There was a small scrape on him but no punctures or bleeding anywhere, and when i picked him up he did not act as if it hurt him. He was a little spooked, i could tell and he did eat a few treats. He has even been running on his saucer all night in his cage as if there is nothing wrong, but now that energy seems to have wore off...he is resting alot and it has only been a few hours but I am concerned that if one of the dogs did get ahold of him, should i be worried About internal bleeding or is that over thinking too mucg? Ihave not yet gone to the vet because i honestly cannot afford to right now and I feel horrible but i have no way to payfor the visit.

My ribs stood out underneath taut, burning hot skin. My lungs rattled with mucus. My eyes were dark and sunken, dulled by the strange virus that laid waste to me every year. I lay in the center of the stained mattress, shivering in unmerciful sunlight cutting through the tattered curtains. 
The flies droned. Dozens of them, lazy fat bodies looping around my head and settling playfully on my face. They rubbed their hands together and waited.
My mother opened the door and took a long look at me, gnawing her lip. I stared back, too weak to lift up my head. She closed the door without a word, and I would have sobbed then if my eyes weren't bone-dry and aching from the effort of every blink. 
My little dog whimpered hungrily beside the bed and I whispered to him ""I'm sorry."" 
A tear slipped out, hot and cold against my desert skin. There was no food left in the house. There was no heat, water, or electricity. 
Faintly, I heard the radio playing James Brown and my mother cackling through the walls.
She had spent the money on new furniture and copper pans, and I knew that she was dancing through the kitchen with a bottle of rum. 
I shut my eyes and drifted, floating away from my body as the illness suffocated me. 
When I opened them, it was night. 
The cicadas replaced the flies, which had retired to my windowsills. 
The room was dim, save a slice of silvery lamplight    glowing through the blinds. My breath rasped in my throat as I lifted a skeletal arm up and wiggled my fingers. The shadow danced on the cracked plaster ceiling, and I gave a small smile. It fascinated me. 
I felt impossibly weightless as my hands became rabbits and snakes. They hunted and fought each other, killed and gorged as my dark eyes watched, empty belly groaning in pain. A stretch of time passed, I don't know how much, 'till it finally tired me. 
My hands floated down to my sides and I stared at the foot of my bed. Gradually, my mouth began to hang open. Every breath rasped. My heart tattooed faintly in my ears as my eyes unfocused. 
Slowly, very slowly, something began to rise from the floor. 
My pulse gained volume, the sound crashing through my head as something lifted its face just beyond the footrest and stared back at me. 
Its hair swung in putrid strands over a dark, blister covered face. A pair of twisted horns spiralled up from its forehead, tips shining red. 
Its eyes were black and cold as obsidian, and it somehow shivered with energy while remaining perfectly still. Unfathomable hatred radiated from it, hitting me in waves. My heartbeat faltered as it gave me a wide grin. Its filthy teeth were sharp as knives. It wiggled a long, rotting tongue at me, clumps of maggots dropping from its mouth with audible 'plop's. I was terrified out of my mind to the point that I'd stopped breathing. We held eye contact for what seemed like an eternity until at last
I blinked. 
It had vanished without a trace. I tried to scream but my throat had constricted. 
All that came out was a dusty whine. 
I don't know how I slept through the rest of that night, but my fever broke the next day. Even now, thinking back to that time, my lungs seize in horror.
 Late at night, when my room is dim, I remember the visceral agony that beset my childhood. I remember its graveyard smile. 
I close my eyes and wait like a statue, like a rabbit hiding from a snake.

However, I don't think the team is basing their decisions on actual data.  I feel like they are operating almost whimsically.  Nerfing certain cards time and time again and buffing cards that don't need it.  I already faced witch often and now that's all I face.  Meanwhile, every month sees another nerf to ram or ram rider.  Now bandit has been nerfed.

Are they really trying to balance the game?  Because I don't see any actual balancing taking place.  I see ""let's make this strong card strong; lets make this weak card weaker""  Next month pekka will be nerfed and golem will be buffed because...""balancing""",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:36:30

EP meets a neckbeard,1,b8tk47,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/b8tk47/ep_meets_a_neckbeard/,0,1554266187.0,"What happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object? Well I found out recently 

I’m twenty but look younger most people assume that I’m 17 but I act a lot older and firmer so people don’t really mess with me after I talk back to them, but even though I act older people still sometimes think I’m younger so I have to deal with EP’s (both entitled people and entitled parents) AND neckbeards who think I’m a loli on top of that I really like video games and anime so yeah even more neckbeard bait. 

Anyways into the story

So I went to go to a local video game let’s just call it samegtop. I went to samegtop to get black ops 4 since I had been hearing from my brother about how amazing it was (I live with my twin brother, not identical obviously). I hop out of my car and start walking toward the samegtop when I notice and neckbeard walking towards me I book it into the samegtop and he follows me in. Unlike most neckbeards this guy wasn’t blatantly creepy he didn’t try talking to me about video games or d&d or anime or some other thing he just followed me through the isles and subtly stared at me, I don’t think he nticed I could see him because I was wearing sunglasses (yes I wear sunglasses inside In know Im a douch). I finally decided to look at the neckbeard when he’s staring. I basically snap my neck with how fast I turn towards him and say “the f*ck do you want”. The weird smile he had when he was staring immediately dissipates and he under his breath goes “ugh, females these days”. I was surprised when he just walked away I thought I was gonna have a really neckbeard experience. He walked over to the funko pop dolls are and starts looking. There were only a couple on display and there were a lot of empty spaces on the rack.  

This is when the entitled parents walks in talking on the phone with an expensive looking purse and “I want to speak to the manager haircut” with a child who’s eyes light up when he sees the funko pops. The EP barely puts up a fight when the kid runs off from her towards the dolls. He immediately points at one and says “THIS ONE” at the top of his lungs it actually made me jump a little. The EP ends the call and shuffles, literally shuffles, over to the pops tiredly crouch’s and looks at the one he’s pointing at, I’m pretty sure it was rick from rick and morty). My full attention is on the EP since because i thought maybe instead of a neckbeard story I would get an EP story. Neither I or the EP notice the neckbeard hobble over toward her side of the rack. The EP grabs the figure and hands it to the kid. He grabs it with glee and then immediately it’s taken away by the neckbeard and he starts to say “Rick and morty why would a child want this, the show it too highbrow for a simple child to understand, stupid children thinking they could understand such complexity”. The EP instantly shook off her tired demeanor and snatched the figure from the neckbeard and starts berating the neckbeard with insults. 

She starts going off about how she’ll sue him for fake charges and assault. She even said “IF YOU DONT PAY FOR WHATEVER GAME MY SON WANTS I WILL SUE YOU”. The EP raises her hand and keeps it there screaming that she will slap him if he ever touches her son again. The neckbeard gets into this weird stance with his hands ready to karate chop her and I swear to god says “Go ahead I’ve studied all types of marshal arts...” and then the cherry on top”... i’ve even studied the blade”. The EP looks dumbfounded and so does the cashier and I’m trying my hardest not to laugh and the EP puts down her hand. I’m assuming she didn’t know internet culture so she probably didn’t know that with one hit the neckbeard would’ve gone down like a sack of potatoes. 

The EP glares at the neckbeard and grabs her kid and goes into a different isle. The neckbeard goes back to looking for a figure. The EP comes back with the kid holding a game and goes up to the counter and puts the stuff on there. The cashier scans it and when the cashier says the price the EP pauses and says “Excuse me do you know who I am?” she glared at the cashier and starts on about how she’s super important because she volunteers at her kids school saying she’s doing the community a favor by deciding to keep living her “even though I could just leave and take my money with me”. I lost all respect I had for this woman that she had gained screaming at the neckbeard. 

The cashier isn’t taking her crap and the EP decides to play the victim card. She went on and on about how the neckbeard assaulted her acting like the cashier couldn’t clearly see them the whole time. She added “I’m a single mother so could you just forget about the game and charge me for the doll”. This is when the neckbeard decides to come out and say “No wonder you’re single with and attitude like that, it’s the same with all women these days feminists have ruined things for men”. The EP grabbed the doll off the counter and threw it at the neckbeard then grabbed her kid and dashed out of the store. The neckbeard chased after her and the police were called. Both go arrested and I don’t know what happened after. I honestly couldn’t believe that I got to see both of these stereotypes pushed to there extremes go face to face.",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:36:27

Every single post I came across had men in the comments refuting the claim that women earn less than men. 

It’s a somewhat complex topic so I can understand  arguments on context (ex: wage vs earnings), ok fine, nit picky AF but fine. But MOST of what I see is just outright denial from men. I’m always curious about the outpouring of denial - besides general patriarchal and toxic masculinity issues surrounding not wanting to give up their power seat at the top, what gives?? What do men gain by saying this gap doesn’t exist?

So my entire character is human in ever way, but with a werewolf body clipped on still. I can't really go first person cause I just see the inside of the werewolf mouth.

I don't have any mods related to werewolves.

Things I've tried to fix it:

- reload old saves (but not so far that it's before I even got the abilitily to turn into a werewolf.)

- wait until I can change into a werewolf again. Change into one, then turn back to human.

-change my race.

-change my gender.

-unequip all armour and re equip. 

-probably some other stuff that I can't remember.

Please, does anyone have a fix for this? It's getting very frustrating.

My last save that was before werewolf stuff was very far back and I'd like to not go so far back. (Yeah amateur mistake)",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:36:16

So pretty much the title. I have a 1Gbit connection, usually about 500-850 download, depending on peak hours and 800 upload, pretty constant.

I have a server that does all the downloading and I set the download speed of the software on that server to 40Mbps. This is not even 50% of my connection, but while its downloading, everyone on my internet pretty much gets slowed down to a halt. Youtube video are buffering like crazy.

My router is a RT-AC5300. I was wondering if there is something I can do where I can give the server its own dedicated 200/200 connection from my 1G connection, so that no matter what it download or upload, everyone else on my internet doesn't lag?",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:36:15

At first it was just a couple of times but it's starting to happen more frequently. The concern is that eventually they'll be taking money out of our driver's pockets. The owners are starting to get mad about it. They want to make sure their drivers get money even if it costs them some sales. For the record, drivers keep all tips and all delivery fees. But our fees are based on distance and range from $1.50 - $4.00.

The problem is we don't know it's one of these services until they show up. And we aren't going to refuse the sale. They want to set it up so they only operate in the areas outside of our delivery range. What recourse do they have? Has your store had to deal with this? How did it work out?

Not quite sure what is going on,1,b8tk0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/b8tk0j/not_quite_sure_what_is_going_on/,0,1554266168.0,"I don't know much about mental health, aside from the more commonly taught issues such as clinical depression and anxiety disorders, mostly because a multitude of my friends have to deal with these on a daily basis, so, I apologize if this is the wrong reddit to post on to ask questions like these, but I appreciate any help offered (I'm new to reddit, so sorry for that as well!).

&#x200B;

I'm having an issue with my emotions, more specifically how quick I am to flip between emotions or am provoked. 

&#x200B;

Some days feel like everything is crushing me inside, a day like this being where after I lashed out at someone and I cried a multitude of times (at separate intervals throughout the day), finding it hard to breathe with how shaken I was. To my recollection, there wasn't anything too stressful going on around me to have caused this kind of reaction. Yes, my relationship with this person I snapped at isn't the best, in fact I'd say its the closest I've gotten to 'hating' someone in a while, but I deal with them on a daily basis (with grit teeth) so this should have really been another average day. 

&#x200B;

And after that day, it was fairly average, except for the dizzy and hazy feeling I continued to have, everything feeling like too much or too little all at once. I continue to have hazy days like this now, even weeks after this one incident. This isn't the only time this has occurred, feeling dizzy, but its a lot more frequent now as of ever.

&#x200B;

I cry easily, but I also get angry easily.

&#x200B;

I do not have an anger management problem, at least from my knowledge, but I am very quick to anger when provoked. When my friends tease me, I tease back, but there are instances where my anger has overcome me and made me sick. One day, a very close friend of mine was crying, curled up in a ball thanks to her best friend for reasons I think are too personal to name, but this friend of her's came by and proceeded to act friendly towards the group (my friend included). Instantly, and I feel kind of scared by this now, I lashed out, biting back and shoving the 'ex-friend' back and telling them to, as I so eloquently said, 'fuck off'. That would have been the end of it, but they provoked further by insulting me to my face, and I in another irrational fit of anger had to be held back by the acquaintance of mine I had been recently introduced to.

&#x200B;

Is it normal to have such flips in emotions? From calm to irrational anger in seconds? To quiet to bawling my eyes out because I got told off by two people for being rude? I feel as if I'm unstable in the sense that I could break down any second, like a big ball of emotions and tension ready to burst. 

&#x200B;

I see many people on Reddit claiming that its better to have it then to not have it in the unlikely (but possible) event that you get cancer or are involved in a serious accident. I'm not worried about that at all.

My solution would be to simply earn less income so that I fall into the poverty level category. This might not even be by choice given the potential relative circumstances of a catastrophic health event. I could almost immediately qualify for free housing, free food, and of course medical treatment of all kinds including cancer and/or critical surgery/therapy/check-ups etc.

This is probably making some of you laugh, I'm chuckling to myself honestly, but in all fairness- Isn't it somewhat reasonable for someone barely making more than the international poverty level anyway? I've never been on any kind of welfare before but in the event of a serious accident or sudden life-threatening illness, it would be an easy fix. Am I wrong?

I want to know if I'm just losing my mind or not, so give me your opinion. It just makes more sense to me considering there's no way in hell I can afford the monthly payments, let alone a deductible. Btw I'm 27/M in Los Angeles.

With every new patch Riot introduces to balance out champions and items there are some unforeseen issues that creep up and cause disruption during gameplay. We have noticed that these issues which eventually get fixed clutter up the subreddit immediately following the patch.

We want to avoid this by having a single Megathread which will be posted after every patch so that you guys can report the various issues in one place. This allows Riot to easily keep track of the bugs by providing a central hub and also allows other users to confirm that they might have encountered.

Almost no time passes between Beauty and the Beast’s world in 358/2 days and the start of KH2, but they timeskip to around six months later in the course of KH2? Do time axes randomly accelerate and slow down?

Also, a year is measured based on rotation around the sun, but there is no central sun in the Ocean Between, so what is a year?

So many worlds explicitly take place on Earth, but Earth doesn’t exist in Kingdom Hearts, so furthermore why is a year defined as the length of a year on Earth?

"When cows give birth, the mother and calf should be separated.",1,b8tjwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b8tjwo/when_cows_give_birth_the_mother_and_calf_should/,1,1554266146.0,"Let me tell you about something that happened a few days ago. 

My mother and I were finished with early morning chores and after letting the chickens out of the coop, she went over to the dry (pregnant) cows pen to check on how all of the ladies were doing. My mom hops in to check on everyone and not too long after I get a shout to quickly come over; a newborn’s head is tucked under its body, and so it isn’t breathing. My mom wants me to watch momma cow so she has another set of eyes to watch her back, in case momma gets upset. 

Everything went smoothly. Baby wasn’t in that position for too long and so was safe - already trying to stand up and walk around! 

Within the pen we have a small spot for new mommas and babies, gated off from all of the other dry cows. We rotate new pairs when a new calf is born, so when it’s time for a new calf and momma to come in, then mom gets put back in with the regular milking cows and baby gets put into a hutch. 

So, with that being said, my mom grabs the newborn we were just dealing with and brings it over to the gate. She sets down the calf, but as a few dry cows were in the way of the entrance, she has me stand near the pair we were bringing in as she shoos she nearby cows away. As cows are curious creatures, a few of them take a sniff of baby and are on their way. 

But one. 

One, again, sniffs baby and then casually fucking stomps on baby’s stomach while walking away. 

She stomped, I heard a crack, and baby let out a soft “muh”.

My mother was livid, swearing up and down at the cow while I was trying really hard not to cry. I couldn’t believe what I saw. I love cows, but fucking hell, sometimes they are mindless bumbling idiots. 
I felt horrible because I thought I spooked the cow into doing that. And maybe I did, I’ll never truly know why it happened. But a week earlier I remember my dad having to put down a newborn, a beautiful red heifer calf, because both of her back legs were snapped in half from being stepped on. 

This isn’t something that always happens, but dairy cows are not known for being the best mothers. I WOULD rather the calf be in a hutch than with momma, because I would rather call it safe than be sorry for it later. ",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:35:46

I think my friend may be in danger,1,b8tjw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b8tjw5/i_think_my_friend_may_be_in_danger/,0,1554266143.0,"So I’m using a different account to err on the side of caution. Here’s the background:

I’m good friends with this girl, but we’re just friends. We’ve known each other for a while and have a few mutual friends. One of those people is her boyfriend, who she currently lives with along with his parents. They’ve only been dating maybe 8 months, been living together for the better portion of that. When they first hooked up I didn’t really know him at all but a few other people we both knew did, and at one point I was over his house with her to help her fix something and had an opportunity to talk to him. Here’s where it gets unsettling.

For starters, his room is FILLED with clown-related art and paraphernalia. They also have this weird thing of going to events together with clown makeup on, he got her into doing that. Next, he’s borderline obsessed with horror films, specifically related to serial killers and extremely grotesque forms of violence and violent sexual acts. He also enjoys documentaries related to the subject and according to her its pretty much the majority of what he watches. One of the clown posters in his room is John Wayne Gacy, and he often does his clown make up in the same style.

The scary part? She told me at one point that he had a history of mental illness, to the point of having been institutionalized for it, for over a year. I’m not sure exactly when that was or exactly what he was diagnosed with, nor do I know if he takes any kind of meds. 

She also has a habit of talking to me about her relationship issues. I try not to read into this too much, but the short of it that I’ve managed to piece together is that he’s impulsive, apathetic, and detached, but at other times hyperactive, charming, and crudely comedic. He also posts these very odd videos that characterize a seriously messed up, sadistic sense of humor. Some of them also mimic or reenact scenes from horror movies. Nothing about directly killing people or pretending to, though there are implications and allusions to this. One in particular was a spot on recreation of the Would You F**k Me? scene from SotL which was highly unsettling.

Some of their fights have largely been about his personal issues in juxtaposition to her own. She’s been in an abusive relationship before but in ways that were much more obvious and direct, and she broke it off.
I worry this is a much more subtle thing and that he could suddenly snap, or that he may already have and is just putting on an air of sanity or something.

Now I may be just paranoid, which is why I’m coming here, but this particular recipe of serial killer obsession and history of mental illness makes me fear for her safety.
His parents are almost never there, which only adds to it.

What do you guys think? What should I do?I fear confronting her about it will make her not trust me and withdraw. I’ve considered approaching someone else we both know, but I’m not sure if I’m even correct in my fears. I need advice.",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:35:43

My post is more related to the counter posts/comments and I have some questions:
- does the fact something is “intended to work like this” mean it is right? - No, it doesn’t and this sub is the right place to say it.
- is it logical the essential mode of the game to be the most unfair mode of the game as well? - No, it is not.
- Is it normal an esport game to be fully based on p2w? - Definitely not.
- Do you think that everyone is on this sub and all people that don”t like it are here to cry? - No, most of people are just leaving the game, without saying a word.
- Do you think that player base is big enough and a single player is not important? - People are similar, and when we are discussing such a general topic, trust me it is important.
- Does anyone benefit from ladder working that way? - Supercell in short term, maybe. Nobody else, thats for sure.

The solution is there (level cap per rating bracket) in clan war leagues. Another solution is to rework the challenges so they are more f2p mode, then say the ladder is also the account progression mode. 
Right now, there is no f2p mode which is unacceptable (as we can see) for alot of f2p casuals, but most important for an e-sport game.

And the last, but not least - everyone knows the way it works now, and is doing his best to catch up that way. However this sub is the place, where people shall tell Supercell what do they dislike, and that is the best way for both sides. Supercell is a real company and they do not need you to tell them how great they are, it is enough if figures show it.",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:35:37

Albuquerque, NM. 
   I am a 21 year old female, married to my 23 year old husband. 
My husbands mom got addicted to meth/heroin with her boyfriend who is the father of his half-brother who is 5 years old. He grew up in a filthy home with needles everywhere and basically neglected. We found out and anonymously called CYFD. 
Fast forward, we now have the 5 year old in our care for 3 months now. He has had problems at home with outbursts, which have stopped after we moved so he could have his own room. But his outbursts at school seem to be getting worse by the day. 
Today he falsely accused his brother (my husband) of hitting him. Which led to the cops being called and him being questioned. 
We don't even yell at this kid. The cops quickly deemed it a false report once they did an exam and a home visit. But.. this kid obviously needs help. 
We have been ignored by cyfd, the case worker will not answer my calls,texts or emails. And i have been BEGGING for help for the last 2 months. We work WAY too much to be able to take this 5 year old to testing/ counseling. We give him a roof over his head and food in his belly but CYFD is unwilling to help us with his counseling. They seem more willing to help his mom after she gets him back. Which is a slap to my face after my 3 months of caring for him. Any legal action I can take?

I'm 52 - am I on track to retire in 15 years?,1,b8tjux,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/b8tjux/im_52_am_i_on_track_to_retire_in_15_years/,1,1554266135.0,"I’m 52 and single (marital status is unlikely to change), and currently work for a state university. My gross annual salary is $130K, and I do not pay social security tax. I previously worked for a private university and qualify for social security; however, with the windfall elimination provision, I anticipate about $800/mo if I draw social security at 70.

My current retirement savings are as follows:

* TIAA: 403b, IRA, and 403b supplemental retirement plan - total of $464K
* Great-West Retirement: 457b - total of $244K

Monthly retirement savings:

* 403b & 403b supplemental retirement plan: $2062 (includes an employer match of $684)
* 457b: $2003 (no employer match)

Current annual contribution to retirement accounts: $48780

All my retirements accounts are invested similarly: 
75-80% in equity mutual funds and 20-25% in multi-asset mutual funds

The state retirement plans restrict which mutual funds I can invest in. Over the last 9 years, my investment performance has been mediocre - averaging around 9% per annum 

Other savings:

* Gold bullion - approximately $20K at today’s prices
* Emergency fund - $7K 
* Savings account - $17K

House (townhouse) is worth about $300K (neighbor’s townhouse just sold for $325K). I owe $117.5K, and will have it paid off by the end of 2025.

My monthly take home is $5500. My major expenditures are:

* Mortgage - $2000 (includes extra principal payment of $533)
* Car loan - $357 (0% APR ends in June 2021, car is a Ford C-Max - nothing fancy)
* Homeowners policy - $300 (annual $3500)
* Property taxes - $200 (annual $2100)
* Pet Insurance - $60 (annual for 3 cats $700-750)
* Maid service - $175
* Utilities (electric, water, internet) - $210 ($100, $30, $70)
* Medicine - $100
* Food + drink - $400
* Eating out - $400

Monthly Luxuries:

* NBA team half-season ticket - $150/mo (tickets are $1600/yr - I really enjoy the games)
* Opera/theater tickets - $70/mo (I watch 2 shows and take a friend, but I like good seats)

I put $500 into my savings account each month, and am left with a balance of $75-200 in my checking account. I don’t carry credit card debt.

In 2021, when the car payments end, I can put an additional $2100 into pre-tax retirement savings, and that will become $4200 every year after that (only 6 months of savings in 2021).

Starting in 2026, I can put some additional money in pre-tax retirement because I won’t have a mortgage note anymore. I am thinking of putting $12K/yr into my retirement plans and the other $12K into my savings account.

Note that my retirement contribution limits are:

* 403b: $25K
* 403b supplemental retirement plan: $25K
* 457b: $25K

The retirement calculators I use online say I’ll be ok, but I constantly worry about this.",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:35:35

My only paranormal experience on the morning of my great-great grandfather’s birthday,1,b8tjuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/b8tjuj/my_only_paranormal_experience_on_the_morning_of/,0,1554266133.0,"I’m about 13, it’s about 5 am on a weekday and I’m supposed to wake up a few hours later. All of a sudden I wake up for zero reason and sit straight up. Someone walks up to the foot of my bed and stands there, they were about 6’4 and somewhat muscular, but all I saw was the outline of them. I can see the outline because the light in my hallway is on and the figure was blocking the light behind them. All of a sudden they just disappear in thin air. I think it was my dad just seeing if I was awake playing Minecraft all night, so I head upstairs to just grab a glass of milk like any kid does.

I turn on the light to my house’s kitchen and get myself a glass. Around this time is when my dad wakes up to head to work, so it would make sense he was up. He walks into the kitchen and asks me “Chad, why are you up this early?” I stand there confused and take a sip from my milk “What do you mean? You woke me up when you went into my room.” My dad stands there for a second and shakes his head and starts to go to the coffee maker “Chad I just woke up, I have no clue what you’re talking about.” I simply shrug it off and proceed to play Minecraft for the next hour and a half before I gotta get ready for school.

When I come home, my mom has some silly grin on her face. Now unlike me today, my mom believes almost everything paranormal. Every type of conspiracy on Facebook and she might just buy into it. She told me “Dad told me you saw someone this morning and it wasn’t him, is that right?” As I am grabbing myself an after school snack I say “Yea, why?” She then says “Well guess who’s birthday it is?” I then say “Who?” And she says “It’s your great-great grandfather Jerry’s birthday. I guess he came to check in on you.” Now imagine being 13 and being told a fucking *dark shadow soul* is coming to simply “check in on you. I will say I was shook for about a week. 

Every time I remember this story it makes me think, did I actually see something that night or was it just my 13 year old brain fucking with me. I know there’s a theory of some sort of “shadow people” out there that consist of the dead. But I never really bought into it. What’s also weird is that it is the only thing I vividly remember when being 13, which is why I remember a lot from this day.

When I remembered the story recently, I went on to Wikipedia like any smart college student and looked up “Shadow figures”. I almost shit myself, for one I know I have never suffered sleep paralysis, and second off the further I dug into it the more similar stories matched my own.

As much as I don’t believe in the paranormal and supernatural at times, I still wonder if someone or something is still staring at me in the dark.",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:35:33

Existential crisis anyone?,1,b8tjth,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/b8tjth/existential_crisis_anyone/,0,1554266127.0,"Anyone else just having an existential crisis here? 


I keep getting advice from smart, educated people but it’s stuff that doesn’t really help or make me feel better. Honestly just confuses me or reiterates what I have been told a million times.


I don’t even know where to begin for this post or what to expect as the outcome, so sorry for the jumbled mess.


But it’s mainly around my future career, internships, life, you know all that stressful stuff that you only get one shot at. 


Short background: I am a Junior female COGS, machine learning major. I transferred from CC this past fall as a CS major but switched. I have had jobs since I was 16 in management, tutoring, and now a mundane office job. I also play a D2 sport. My main interest is in AI and video games.


You ever just look around and see a bunch of people and think I’m glad I’m not that guy, he’s not going anywhere? Then take a second and think what if I go no where? Some of the places I’ve worked at have such incompetent people. But so many people have their own cars, homes, and families, so it can’t be that hard, right?


I spend so much time looking for internships or jobs online that I find interest in. But I keep running into the qualifications and think there are probably so many people that are better than me for this, or I don’t think I know enough about programming and freeze whenever someone asks me a question. Then have a shower conversation with myself of a million better ways I could’ve answered.


Now I’m supposed to graduate next year and I feel like I’m not ready to lose all the resources and people here but at the same time I want to do something with my life. 

Now, I’m not lazy, depressed, or unwilling to work. I don’t have any debilitating health issues.  I don’t have anything hindering my performance. I genuinely am happy.


I pride myself on my work ethic and competence. I guess I just struggle with the first steps. I make great relationships and get promoted quickly. But just getting the job or talking to people, hanging out, going for lunch, submitting my resume, going to interviews, it’s a lot. I am fine now with a stable job, good grades and I’m healthy but what’s next?


I already feel like I’m running around from place to place, barely getting a break. So how do I do more and maintain everything else? I don’t want to give up my grades or my sport. My job I can if I get a better one that’s paid. 


TLDR: I am competent but feel totally incompetent at the same time. How do you know you’re making the right choice? How do you know the next step to take? 


Any advice, anyone struggling with the same things, or different but similar things, please just let me know this isn’t an isolated existential crisis.

The first has 220k miles, has been a daily driver so has the typical faded paint, and a small patch of rust above driver rim. It has had a new transmission installed recently and drove without any noticible problems. Price 2k

The 2nd has 132k miles, original everything and looks like it was stored in a garage. The paint is perfect and no rust.

At first I thought the second was the obvious choice but was wondering if I would need to be concerned with tranny/engine issues since everything is original. I have not driven the second yet. Price 1.4k

Lately I’ve been doubting God; I feel incredibly guilty and semi-hopeless because of it. 

My question: when have y’all struggled, what helped your doubts, and do y’all still struggle? 

I have not been reading my Bible as much as I should be and I feel that’s the reason behind some of my weariness. Deep down, I know God saved me, and I love him for it because he gave me a heart to love him. 

I’ve just been struggling so much lately.

Today i want to share with you with [paranoia-live.net](https://paranoia-live.net) forum post made by **GirdagFireskull**

It is a basic mutant hunt at its core - the dangerous mutant Shftn-G-SND has escaped and is hiding in PNG sector. This is a small sector, with only 4 floors, but Shftn can shapeshift. So, the players should have fun with that one.

My six characters are:

A cameraman with a penchant for collecting shiny things

A 'stupid' thug who is actually quite intelligent and on the mutant's side.

A R&D gadget tester. (BOOM!)

A mutant hunter who is REALLY paranoid about mutants (think witchhunter from old times)

A medic who doesn't want ANYBODY to die (evil, I know)

And a registered mutant who wants to break free.

A few other additions - the mutant is hiding in the form of a green dustbin on the 3rd level. The level is in complete blackout. One character needs to drop some equipment in....a green dustbin on the 3rd level. The thug knows that a green dustbin on the 3rd level is actually the shapeshifter, who he has to help escape. Now, what if they got the dustbins mixed up? Also, some evil R&D equipment (as per the usual) including a shieldbot that explodes if badly damaged.",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:35:12

(1) I really feel like the third wheel alot of the time. Almost everyday, after me and my friend get off the bus, we'll walk to the school until my other friend will come and stand infront of me only to start talking to him and just leave me standing behind them!!! 

(2) is that whenever I see them on their phones, I see them always texting eachother like theyre best pals! I almost never see them engage in conversation with me, unless if theyre asking me a question or something. It gets really annoying!!!! 

(3) is that whenever I try to socialize with a new person, and get to the stage of asking if they wanna hang out, and they say maybe, it just so happens that they're best pals with my other best pals, and they never even try to get to know me unless if I'm

(4) Im always the person to start conversations!!!! Almost everyday im hoping and checking that my friends will send me a text, or give me a call on something cool happening, but nope! Nothing. And the one time they actually do? Its a question about math, or if I can text somebody ELSE to see if they're awake or some BS Like that! Tonight I've started to realise that almost all of my friendships are built on ME trying to become better friends with my 'pals'.

Now I can assure you that I know that I sound really whiny. And yes, I do. But this has been weighing me down for the past couple of months and I don't know what to do about it. I can't ditch them and find new friends, because One they still are my friends, and two, as I stated earlier everytime I try to branch out everybody's either a dick or already has good friends.

I really want to do something about this but I don't know what to do. I hate knowing that I'm practically the one holding up my relationships with my classmates and its making school really hard. ",new_subreddit,1,2019-04-02 23:35:11

We haven’t communicated well, and we have surprised moderators and the community with big changes. We have apologized and made promises to you, the moderators and the community, over many years, but time and again, we haven’t delivered on them. When you’ve had feedback or requests, we haven’t always been responsive. The mods and the community have lost trust in me and in us, the administrators of reddit.

Today, we acknowledge this long history of mistakes. We are grateful for all you do for reddit, and the buck stops with me. We are taking three concrete steps:

**Tools**: We will improve tools, not just promise improvements, building on work already underway.  u/deimorz and u/weffey will be working as a team with the moderators on what tools to build and then delivering them.

**Communication**: u/krispykrackers is trying out the new role of Moderator Advocate. She will be the contact for moderators with reddit and will help figure out the best way to talk more often. We’re also going to figure out the best way for more administrators, including myself, to talk more often with the whole community.

**Search**: We are providing an option for moderators to default to the old version of search to support your existing moderation workflows. Instructions for setting this default are [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search#wiki_enabling_legacy_search).

I know these are just words, and it may be hard for you to believe us. I don't have all the answers, and it will take time for us to deliver concrete results. I mean it when I say we screwed up, and we want to have a meaningful ongoing discussion. I know we've drifted out of touch with the community as we've grown and added more people, and we want to connect more. I and the team are committed to talking more often with the community, starting now.

There has been a lot of discussion lately —on reddit, in the news, and here internally— about reddit’s policy on the more offensive and obscene content on our platform. Our top priority at reddit is to develop a comprehensive Content Policy and the tools to enforce it.

The overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don’t have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.

Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen:  These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. It’s something we’ve been thinking about for quite some time.  We haven’t had the tools to enforce policy, but now we’re building those tools and reevaluating our policy.

We as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, I’ll be hosting an AMA on Thursday 1pm pst to present our current thinking to you, the community, and solicit your feedback.

PS - I won’t be able to hang out in comments right now. Still meeting everyone here!",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-07-14 16:06:56

Nevermind the crazies, let's have fun and ask me anything!",0,1zg23j,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/,3360,1393866278.0,"Over the past several weeks Satanism, directly and indirectly, has caught the attention of the media. Lunatics are blaming the Devil for their deranged acts of violence, rumors of ""Satanic"" cults are spreading among the tabloids and fans of True Detective are searching for the Yellow Sign in satanic rituals. Peter H. Gilmore, the current High Priest of the Church of Satan, has been [a guest on CNN](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/17/satanist-church-accused-craigslist-killer-not-one-of-us/), [interviewed by the CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/day6/popupaudio.html?clipIds=2438899671) and numerous other outlets (published and unpublished) in an effort to defuse a revival of the Satanic Panic from 80's and 90's. It's a shame that for many people the only exposure to Satanism is in reaction to such grim, pointless insanity; when by and large the Satanists I know are some the most life-loving individuals I've ever encountered. 

Due to the recent media exposure I'm not surprised to see several threads hitting the front page of Reddit mentioning Satanism, attempted AMA's from questionable sources, and a genuine interest in what Satanism and the Church of Satan is actually about. Obviously one can go to the Church of Satan's website and [check out the basic texts](http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php) and [FAQ](http://churchofsatan.com/frequently-asked-questions.php), but we recognize that humans are social creatures and a certain level of interaction can help drive points home.  

That said, my name is Raul A. and I'm an officially ordained Priest in the Church of Satan, and have been an active Satanist for over 10 years. In my time with the Church of Satan, and well before that, I've interacted with Satanists with a wide range of interests, personalities, and backgrounds. I've organized concerts with Satanic folk bands to experimental electronic musicians. I am the technical director of [Radio Free Satan](http://www.radiofreesatan.com/). My wedding was officiated by a Satanic Priest, I enjoyed Tiki drinks and 50's music with High Priestess Peggy Nadramia, and watched Kaiju films and talked Pacific Rim with High Priest Gilmore. I've also known many nonpublic Satanists who, for various reasons, cannot openly proclaim their worldviews.   

Why am I doing this AMA? For one, I think the Reddit community is interested in the topic and has been mostly given a poor representation of what Satanism is about, in theory and practice. I've seen some fairly interesting questions go without responses, and mostly a lot of talk from people who ""read Crowley in high school"" (FYI, Crowley never identified himself as a Satanist, and has very little to with Satanism) or ""knew a guy once"". Responses are often such a bore and miss the point entirely.  

So here's your chance, ask me anything! And, like any decent Satanist, let's make this fun! Let's try things other than the usual ""Why call it Satanism if you don't believe in Satan"" (*), let's talk about life, experiences, and the pleasures of the material world! Let the games begin!  

Proof: http://imgur.com/a/wAPvz?gallery

* The ""Satan"" in ""Satanism"" refers to the Hebrew word for ""the adversary"", and that is the context in which we use it. We understand that the human animal has an innate need for religion, symbolism, and dogma so we Satanists willfully choose the one we most identify with.

Edit: I have a business call to attend to for an hour or so, I'll be back shortly!

Edit: Seems that many of my responses have been downvoted to Hell (ba dum). Here's a handy Q&A table http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/  

Edit: Time to roll up the tent. Overall I had a fairly good time, answered a few good questions, made some new friends, and ran into some old ones. If you haven't seen my responses, especially in the first few hours of this AMA, it's because my comments were immediately being downvoted and hidden from the default views([I didn't realize Reddit were such big fans of the Westboro Baptist Church](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/cfte5pu)).

TIFU by destroying my girlfriend's family :(,0,2lgk2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2lgk2j/tifu_by_destroying_my_girlfriends_family/,1431,1415265547.0,"I've been dating an amazing girl for a bit over a year now. She's pretty chill and progressive, but she comes from a VERY conservative protestant family. Frankly, it's amazing that she isn't disowned - her parents and siblings obviously love her very much, but every time we go to visit they are not shy about voicing their disapproval of her lifestyle choices. Thankfully they're all cordial and the concerns are voiced civilly so there's no raised voices or hurt feelings, but not being part of the family these lectures are quite uncomfortable for me. ESPECIALLY since I'm not spared from her family's criticism.

As you can imagine we don't visit them much. They were kind enough to extend a dinner invitation on Wednesday evening, and since we hadn't seen them in a month or so we took them up on it. Despite the occasional awkward disapproving interjection (which we're both used to by now) things were going well... that is, until I let slip that she and I were thinking about moving in together. At that point her father gave me the coldest gaze I'd ever seen. And he wouldn't stop fucking GLARING at me. From that point on he had no qualms about interrupting me every time I spoke, quoting bible passages to insult me or contradict every single thing I would say in some fashion. I may not have been on exactly the same page as her father before, but we'd gotten along okay nonetheless... it definitely seemed like he was just being rude, obnoxious, and particularly confrontational. Now I'm an extremely even-tempered guy, but he was bagging on me to the extent that I had to excuse myself four goddamn times during dinner because he was pissing me off and I needed to cool down. There were multiple instances where his daughter and wife would even comment on his mean attitude but he seemed to just totally ignore them. This guy obviously intended to goad me.

After dessert my girlfriend and her mother are washing dishes, leaving me and her father alone at the dining room table. After a brief awkward silence I decided to straight-up ask him why he was so upset with me. He revealed that he was wholeheartedly against the idea of his daughter living with an ""unscrupulous heathen"" (his literal words) as that pretty much guaranteed premarital sex. I'd had enough of his shit by this point and decided a dose of reality would straighten him out, but emotion certainly got the best of me and my delivery was incredibly crass. ""If you think it took more than a few weeks to twist your daughter into all kinds of kinky pretzels you can't even imagine and stuff various objects into every hole in her body then you're just being willfully ignorant."" In my defense, I was being honest... she's ridiculously kinky. I still feel bad for being so disrespectful, though.

I have never been punched out of anger before, so when this 64 year old man lunged across the table and struck me I was caught completely off guard. I'm a regular gym-goer and participated in martial arts in the past, but none of that mattered - the next thing I knew I was on my back with this previously-very-collected elderly fellow on top of me in a blood rage. Still dazed from smacking my head on the ground when my chair tipped over, it was all I could do to try and deflect his onslaught of wild blows. It seemed like a fucking eternity before his wife and daughter pulled him off me. I stood up and could feel the sting of blood dripping into my eye. I could taste it in my mouth. I was still dizzy and disoriented but it was obvious that I'd received some pretty solid blows. While I was slightly embarrassed that someone almost twice my age handed me my ass, I nevertheless felt like I won. Like I got him to snap even though he'd been working on me for hours.

My girlfriend ushered me into the bathroom and began to gingerly tend my wounds. Her mother and father were hollering back and forth incomprehensibly in the dining room downstairs; when I heard them say her name I assured her I was fine on my own and urged her to deal with her folks. More incomprehensible yelling ensued, though my girlfriend's voice now joined the chorus. Around the time I'd managed to staunch the bleeding from my eyebrow she returned with my coat and said simply, ""We're leaving."" She was angrier than I'd ever seen her yet managed to remain collected. Normally when we'd leave her parents' house there were fond farewells... warm handshakes, hugs, wishes for prosperity, and blessings abound. Not this time, though. This time there was only her mother crying alone at the dinner table; we didn't even stop to say good-bye. Her father was nowhere to be found. Nothing but silence while we got into the car and left the driveway. A few miles down the road I noticed tears in my girlfriend's eyes. I wanted to be there for her, to comfort her in some way, but I just didn't know how. ""Do you want to talk about it?"" I asked, feeling stupid that I couldn't come up with something more suave to break the silence. ""Not right now"" she said, her voice strained against the flood of emotion. I put one of my hands in hers and squeezed ever so slightly, letting her know without words that I was there for her when she was ready. She squeezed back, refusing to break down sobbing even as large, heavy tears rolled down her face. We rode the rest of the way without saying anything.

**TL;DR**: *SO's dad intentionally pushes my buttons HARD. I tell him I thoroughly fucked his daughter. He physically attacks me. Everyone loses.*

Fnatic vs OG had more viewers than CLG vs TSM.,39,41djec,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/41djec/fnatic_vs_og_had_more_viewers_than_clg_vs_tsm/,1456,1453037994.0,"Even with the significantly worse time-slot and broadcast day.

[The EU numbers were posted here and I'm using the screenshot that was taken from this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/413fh5/fnatic_vs_og_peaked_at_622035_on_multiple/).

Note: I took the NA screenshots much later during the mid/end of the TSM/CLG game, and the 2nd screenshot is from 10 minutes later (when I realised I need to add the Azubu screenshot since I forgot it existed).

[EU](http://imgur.com/fbSXJFs) vs [NA](http://imgur.com/a/pTlOX)

I shouldn't need to say it, but the person who took the EU screenshot is 1 hour ahead of my time-zone, hence why it looks like it was at the same time, but that person's timezone was GMT+1, whereas mine is GMT+0.

Now considering the only other evidence we have from recent times about viewership numbers between regions was the Summer finals, which also had a lot more viewers for EU over NA, this narrative of ""NA gets more viewers"" seems completely false, even when given a faster better broadcast slot, the numbers don't seem to back the statement up.

EDIT: Don't know why people are trying to argue against facts with their own opinions. This are statistics, facts, things that are provable true.

Your trying to argue against that with your opinions. That's irrelevant.

EDIT2: I didn't realise how stupid NA viewers actually were, this was an impressive example. Your example of the NFL play-offs actually benefits my own argument, with the EU broadcast time-slot, it's like having NFL play-offs every single broadcast.

And yet EU still gets more viewers.

"reddit changes: individual up/down vote counts no longer visible, ""% like it"" closer to reality, major improvements to ""controversial"" sorting",0,28hjga,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/,14064,1403120379.0,"""Who would downvote this?"" It's a common comment on reddit, and is fairly often followed up by someone explaining that reddit ""fuzzes"" the votes on everything by adding fake votes to posts in order to make it more difficult for bots to determine if their votes are having any effect or not. While it's always been a necessary part of our anti-cheating measures, there have also been a lot of negative effects of making the specific up/down counts visible, so we've decided to remove them from public view.

The ""false negativity"" effect from fake downvotes is especially exaggerated on very popular posts. It's been observed by quite a few people that every post near the top of the frontpage or /r/all seems to drift towards showing ""55% like it"" due to the vote-fuzzing, which gives the false impression of reddit being an extremely negative site. As part of hiding the specific up/down numbers, we've also decided to start showing much more accurate percentages here, and at the time of me writing this, the top post on the front page has gone from showing ""57% like it"" to ""96% like it"", which is much closer to reality.

(Edit: since people seem confused, the ""% like it"" is only on *submissions*, as it always has been.)

As one other change to go along with this, /u/umbrae recently rolled out a much improved version of the ""controversial"" sorting method. You should see the new algorithm in effect in threads and sorts within the past week. Older sorts (like ""all time"") may be out of date while we work to update old data. Many of you are probably accustomed to ignoring that sorting method since the previous version was almost completely useless, but please give the new version another shot. It's available for use with submissions as a tab (next to ""new"", ""hot"", ""top""), and in the ""sorted by"" dropdown on comments pages as well.

This change may also have some unexpected side-effects on third-party extensions/apps/etc. that display or otherwise use the specific up/down numbers. We've tried to take various precautions to make the transition smoother, but please let us know if you notice anything going horribly wrong due to it.

I realize that this probably feels like a very major change to the site to many of you, but since the data was actually misleading (or outright false in many cases), the usefulness of being able to see it was actually mostly an illusion. Please give it a chance for a few days and see if things ""feel"" better without being able to see the specific up/down counts.",controversial_subreddit,1,2014-06-18 14:39:39

My girlfriend has some serious munchies because she wanted to go get one really badly. Being an amazing boyfriend I surprise her by taking her there later that night. We go and pick up 3 of them and started heading back to my place. Then I get the romantic idea to take her to the local lake to look at the stars while we eat. Everything was going amazing, it was nice and cool outside, the stars were out and bright. Then she asks for some hot sauce to go with her burrito. As I'm grabbing for it I realize that this was the same exact place we met about a year ago at a college party. I give her the packet and then reach for one for me. The next thing I hear is a lound scream and then ""Yes, yes. Oh god yes."" I turn around to see her in tears and smiling at me.  I'm fucking confused as hell at this point. Then she says ""Of course I will marry you!""

While there are many legitimate reasons for us to be angry, upset, and for some of us just plain pissed off, we need to keep in mind both [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and some general respect for not only the opinions of others, but for those who are just doing their job.

We should be focusing more on constructive feedback, general ideas, and discussion. Having the constant reposts of bashing, inappropriate and disrespectful posts and titles, and just complete disregard for any sort of respect has quickly turned this subreddit into something where [not only the developers](https://twitter.com/andrewwillmott/status/311950660964859905), but just general users have been pushed away from. Users who have posted legitimate questions about concerns, general fixes, or just some ideas for towns or actual discussion have quickly been buried in favor of posts which just follow the general trend of bashing. While this may be okay in other subreddits, I feel that this is not the kind of atmosphere we want in r/SimCity.

 Existing posts will not be removed based on this material, but newer posts which do not provide any sort of constructive feedback or general discussion towards SimCity (including excess foul language, abuse towards others, and personal attacks aimed at the team or specific people) has the potential to be removed by me or the other moderators on the team.

* Memes will be removed
* Only constructive posts are allowed: Posts that clearly define the problem ~~and give possible solutions~~. We're not looking for people to fix the game for EA or Maxis, we're looking for respectful reporting methods. Ex: ""PSA: The population feature is broken. It's given a false read to the user which can negatively impact gameplay"" is much more efficient than ""Fuck this game, everything is lying to us this piece of crap"" Posts that are pure bashing or don't offer any sensible advice will be deleted.
* Only posts that are directly related to the game, thus excluding general EA bashing, Origin bashing and other things that only attract hate.
* **Absolutely NO personal Information.** This is not only a rule of the subreddit, but of [Reddit itself](http://www.reddit.com/rules).

(These rules are holding here for the time being until we can get the subreddit back on track. These points and the general works of the subreddit will be placed up for public discussion where we can all vote and rule out things that we want/don't want to see. Until then, please follow these posting guidelines.)

We will soon be updating the sidebar with some more posting guidelines to help narrow down what we are looking to filter out. While we understand anger due to the new game and behavior that we have received from EA, Origin, and SimCity, we need to understand there are those who are just doing their job and really have no control over the outcome of your conversation with them (obviously this is not the case for all). While posting here, we are going to request some respect from you as a Subreddit. There is plenty of content offering excellent feedback and constructive criticism towards the game – which is exactly what we want.  

So we’ve all had our fun, but it’s time we get SimCity back on track. Many users have been reporting abusive posts and messaging the mods about questionable content - It’s important to understand that we take every report and message and read through it thoroughly.

Stomps 5v5 finals bo5 vs CIS. And cant go LA allstars because midlaner of cis (kira) won 1v1 tournament haha. What a joke. 1v1 bo1 tournament means nothing, it doesnt determine skill. If you want to make 1v1 tournament decide tournament winner, then why its BO1? Atleast make it bo3. Also league of legends  is a team game. We saw naru vs kira (1v1 champion) first match.  Naru went 18-1 LOL.

Turkey deserved it.

Edit: holyphoenix pentakill in game 2  
Edit 2: game 3 cis stomped, game 4 tr stomped 3-1 tr wins

Edit 3: also i want to add that cis's 4 players was from the same team lol

Edit 4: for a wildcard region going allstars facing with worlds best teams is huge experience and huge fun for fans.

Edit 5: yes i know im salty. Wouldnt you guys be salty when your regions allstar team wins 8 out of 10 5v5 games, wins 5v5 finals (clearly the best team in the tournament) and cant make it to LA Allstars.",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-11-28 23:16:42

Was there for Origen vs FW and although the the atmosphere was pretty good, the booing of FW was pretty embarrassing.  Read that post by the Aussie guy that said there were no booing going on.  He must have been deaf.

Just don't think it is a good image to give broadcasted wideworld nor for the EDG team coming over.  Cheer for Frantic but give some respect to the other team.  Ta.

TIFU by not paying enough attention,26,4wkj8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4wkj8b/tifu_by_not_paying_enough_attention/,212,1470569974.0,"Did not happen today, but a couple of weeks ago.

My wife and I have just had our third wonderful child. Not wanting a fourth, we agree I should get a vasectomy. No big deal: just a little snip and removes all the worries with contraception.

My doctor didn't seem to understand why I wanted it, but I quickly dismissed him, insisting I had thought hard about what I wanted and was not going to change my mind. Same with the consultant. I sign the papers and the operation is booked.

A few weeks later, after I wake up from the operation, everything feels fine but numb. Consultant gives me some strong warnings about being careful with my penis over the next fortnight, but I don't take it too seriously.

After my wife has driven me home, we take off my trousers to take a look at the scrotum scar. The head of my penis is wrapped in a soft bandage. She removes it and screams. I look down. It is covered in blood and we can't find my foreskin. Scrotum seems normal.

After we calm down, wife fetches my papers. Turns out I had booked myself in for a circumcision, not a vasectomy. Not their fault: my wife remembered me getting the words confused a few times over the past weeks as well.

Recovery was unpleasant. For a week, woke up every few hours in the middle of the night, somewhere between screaming and crying because the stitches were being stretched. Could not walk properly. Penis looks like someone else's. Two weeks after the operation, I am only just getting anywhere near back to normal. My boss is not impressed either.

And I need to go back to pay for the vasectomy I wanted in the first place.

Tl;DR: Meant to get a vasectomy, got two words confused, didn't listen to warnings, lost my foreskin.",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-08-07 06:39:34
Darius is the only champion in the game who uses mana as resource but can not run out of mana in any way!,77,3jhg4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3jhg4t/darius_is_the_only_champion_in_the_game_who_uses/,1036,1441285861.0,"1. Darius is the only champion who uses mana but can not run out of mana, even if he keeps spamming all his abilities the moment they come off cooldown.

2. Darius is the only champion who uses mana as resource and has a full combo mana cost of **105 mana** at level 18! The second lowest full combo mana cost is ..... Darius, pre-level 16 (with only 205 mana)!

3. Darius is the only mana champion of the whole game who has 4 abilities that do not need more mana when leveling up.


I'm not saying this makes Darius too strong, not at all. I'm fine with Darius the way he is, but I just find it a bit strange why Darius still uses mana as a resource if he can't run OOM in any way. It's kind of useless in my eyes.

Some suggestions:

-  Give his Q an increased mana cost. It is a high damage ability that cost 30 mana the whole game.

- Lower his base mana and/or mana per level.

- Remove mana as his resource, like Garen, or give it a new resource.",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-09-03 08:11:01

The problem with Hai's finger,8,3ofjon,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ofjon/the_problem_with_hais_finger/,1049,1444640554.0,"I think that the majority agrees that Hai's finger was ment as a joke and shouldn't be taken too serious. The problem arises when you look at similar actions of other players in the past and Riot's response. 

Svenskeren chooses ""Taiwanese ChinChong"" as username --> 3 game ban, SK's chances of making it past the group stage demolished. Please note that this also has financial consequences because of the substantial loss of prize money.

Is Svenskeren an actual racist? Probably not. Was Hai's finger actually serious? Probably not. We can't prove either. 

But what we can do is demand consistency in Riot's application of the rules. Riot, a company from the USA, takes their understanding of morale and applies it to the whole world, ignoring the cultural context of the other contintents and countries. But when it comes to actions of players in their own region they respect the cultural context and hand no punishment.

This is inconsistent and regardless of what you think of Hai's finger shouldn't be accepted.

edit: I want to point out for the people that see a flaw in the comparison which can be discussed separately that Hai's finger violated the [2015 World Championship Rules](https://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/lolesports/Rule%20Sets/2015%20Revised%20World%20Championship%20Rule%20Set%20Version%201_01.pdf). I didn't create this post because I hate Hai and I want him to get fined but because numerous other pros received punishments and it would be nice to see everyone treated equally.

Tanya quickly became a popular performer in the MILF genre. When the Liverpool born beauty starred in the controversial Tanya Tate’s Sex Tour of Ireland, she found herself spotlighted in the headlines of the mainstream press. A sex scene that featured Tanya and an Irish pro-athlete became tabloid fodder across England and Ireland. Capitalizing on her skyrocketing career, Tanya ventured to the adult entertainment capital of the world; Los Angeles. There, Tanya began filming for top tier adult companies such as Digital Playground, Vivid, Wicked Pictures and Brazzers. Tanya has also been an FHM magazine cover model and seen in the theatrically released documentary, Aroused, from acclaimed photographer Deborah Anderson. She was seen across the UK in Channel 4’s nationally broadcast reality program Date My Pornstar. After firmly establishing herself as an in-demand performer, Tanya made the move to the director’s chair, specializing in lesbian-themed erotica for Filly Films.

Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  

As a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.  Please discuss the issues and the comments made, not the persons making them.  If you find comments which violate our rules, you’re encouraged to use the report button or alert the mods via modmail so that we can investigate.

Is it wrong to give every single rune page a GoT spoiler as a name?,21,26y9r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/26y9r4/is_it_wrong_to_give_every_single_rune_page_a_got/,747,1401538114.0,"A little background: I hate lolnexus and similar sites. I learned to read the enemie's runes by clicking them and doing a little soft calculating.

I used to watch scarra's stream and I was amazed how he could just tell the runes onthe spot. ""Yeah, he probably has MS quints, but AP blues. And 21/9 masteries"". 

So I learned that and I developed a pretty good accuracy.

Now, here's the thing: I main Riven and I play her almost exclusively, but I'm only Gold. So whenever I get into a game, I get this ""WTF!? X Riven Games and only Gold? Noob!"" - from Silver summoners. It's worse if I equip the Championship skin, which I apparently bought for 700$.

Long story short:

**TL;DR:** The names of my most used rune pages are HUGE Game of Thrones Spoilers (like... ""XY dies next episode / next season"") and I get reported for that shit almost every game, but I don't care - If you scout somebody with 3rd party apps, it's your own risk.

Riot's ask.fm are finally killing my motivation for League of Legends,437,3ei2k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ei2k9/riots_askfm_are_finally_killing_my_motivation_for/,1683,1437778651.0,"I've played this game since season 1 and have countless hours of fun, laughter and enjoyment to thank it for.

Various things over the past couple of seasons have worn down my patience. At the end of the day, though, I still loved the game and could deal with the crap in the peripheries because I had hope that Riot would come good at some point.

Reading the ask.fm answers from Lyte and Ghostcrawler over the past few weeks have totally destroyed that hope. I always believed that - whilst Riot might be slow and frustrating - they had their hearts and minds in the right place. But the shit these two have been coming out with has made me realise that the problems aren't born out of anything I can come to terms with. Riot games is just running on philosophies I (and apparently many others) fundamentally and whole-heartedly disagree with and that is totally demoralising.

The sentiment I present seems to be very much shared by the majority on here and amongst people I play with. For the first time since I started playing, I think League's long-term future is at immediate risk.
 
I'm interested to hear the other side though. Perhaps this is just fatigue born out of playing the same game for too long (although I do still love the *game*). Perhaps newer players feel more optimistic. Perhaps I'm just a cynic.",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-07-24 17:57:31

"The ""Toxicity"" in the community is so exaggerated.",302,23o7ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/23o7ix/the_toxicity_in_the_community_is_so_exaggerated/,1198,1398168131.0,"Honestly, This sub is plagued by people constantly moaning about the community and how they have ""quit the game"" or will ""never play ranked again"".

It's just ridiculous, the community is nowhere near as bad as a lot of these people make out. I'm currently in gold 3 on EUW and I see 1 or 2 ""toxic"" players in about 5 games of playing, so 2/45 (edited, I included myself 5 times) and most of the time if someone is being toxic the rest of the players just ignore them and deal with it very well.

I really think people need to grow up and realize sometimes people are going to flame or be a bit of an ass. But that's just life, it happens everywhere, not just in league.

But this will probably get down voted to the Reddit graveyard because apparently everyone on this sub is a ""victim"" of a game and it's community.

EDIT: When I stated my division and how many ""toxic"" players I encounter roughly, It was for the purpose of showing that I cannot speak necessarily for people in other divisions or servers. Players experience varies, and I am basing this post off my own experiences.

Also I'm not saying toxicity isn't a problem, I still think we need a system in place that rewards positive players and ""remedies"" the negative ones. However this sub seems to make out that every game is going to be a huge rage fest between your team, which is not the case. 

This kind of talk discourages new players and makes current players just feel bad for themselves, nothing good ever comes from it.",controversial_subreddit,1,2014-04-22 07:02:11

I do not remember much clearly from early seasons, or promo talks/vidoes, but ever since S5, NA was always most important. At IEM everyone knew that GE are strongest, and that it was major upset from WE, everyone talked like TSM could beat GE in Finals. At MSI, TSM again was overhyped, saying they could easy play on EDG and SKT level. There was even that player video, of NA players saying TSM will end in finals vs EDG or SKT. After summer split, even after FNC best season, Origen's super teamplay and H2K's good macro game show, CLG was overhyped since they won finals in MSG against TSM. During group draws if it wasn't for Deficio and Spawn to talk about every region, we know what Jatt or any NA caster would talk about. Even after them most talk was about CLG getting easiest group to get out. About KOO only was said that they are weakest team coming from LCK(they ended in finals !), Flash wolves were barely mentioned, they mentioned how Steak was bad top laner, but it was barely mentioned that Maple is super good mid laner. In Group B, ""group of death"", Deficio and Spawn, talked about all teams ( FNC,IG,AHQ,C9), Jatt was only speaking of C9 which ended in his twitter apology to Balls. In Group D ""the group of chance"" that maybe teams can upset KT or LGD, our dear friend Jatt talked about Bjergsen and TSM. At the start of S6 IMT were instantly compared to FNC of S5, even though their bottom 3 members can never be compared to likes of Febi,Rekkles,YS. 



After facing TSM , interview asked GMB how did he feel after Bjergsen. ??????? GBM was facing entire season mids like Faker,CoCo,Kuro,Nagne,Goong. What is Bjergsen compared to these mid laners ? Geez... Also Phreak non-stop keep mentioning how Hai is probably best shotcaller in League of Legends. Ughh , Phreak, remember a Korean mid laner called Dade?? The guy that C9 wanted to get, but couldn't compete with China. Dade, one of best LoL players to ever play, and main shotcaller of SSB, and probably shared shotcalling with Mata in Samsung Ozone(SSW). Next do u remember Mata ? Greatest support of all time. Do u remember YS, the guy that was praised by Picaboo,Gorilla,Wolf at worlds, also praised by Mata. LMS is barely ever mentioned. AHQ are probably better than IMT,H2K,VIT,G2, and they can't even get invited to 1 Internation event outside worlds and MSI ? Remember the top 20 players list? There is extreme bias from Riot's side but its more towards NA than towards any other region, not just TSM and C9",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-02-29 05:27:13
"""Do not play Ranked on Sunday.""",0,2s5qid,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2s5qid/do_not_play_ranked_on_sunday/,983,1421065699.0,"This is what a friend that has spent tons of time in League has been telling me for a while. Before you jump the gun, this is not a sob story, just an advice. I usually never play League on weekends, but yesterday I was feeling like it and said: ""Huh, sure he is exagerating"". Here is what happened.

First game: I was third pick and last pick said ""Mid"". I picked Zed anyway and he says ""Ok, np I go top"". He picks Aatrox and once we are in the game he goes mid, starts feeding, and only buys tears of the goddess. He tricked us so nooone would dodge to then fuck the game for everyone. Kudos for that, that is just plain evil.

Second game: I was last pick, I said I'd fill. First pick picks Ahri, and third pick, for some reason, doesn't trust in Ahri and goes Nidalee and goes mid. At one point Ahri gets angry for not getting cs and goes afk. Neat.

Third game: I pick jungle Gragas and this top Rengar doesn't beleive in viability, and before giving me a chance, gives 3 kills to Fiora and goes afk. At this moment I'm not even mad, I'm amazed.

But because I'm stupid, I go for a 4th game: The Soraka in my team goes afk during laning phase because he didn't like our Ezreal, saying he couldn't hit q's. That Ezreal was me. I wasn't even aiming for the poke, I was securing cs. 

The result is -100lp  more or less. I almost never get angry (luckily), but holy shit wasn't I impressed.

Lesson learned. Wait till the kids are at school to play ranked. 


**Edit**: 

For those majored in statistics saying ""But the enemy team has more chances to get a troll than your team! You SHOULD play Ranked on Sundays"".

Turns out, I'm one of the few guys that plays for fun and not for elo. I don't enjoy 4v5, even when I'm the team with 5.

""BUT THEN WHY DO YOU PLAY RANKED, YOU TURD-MOLESTING QUIM?""

The answer is easy, ranked sticks to the meta. I like the meta. Ranked players are competitive (when they actually play), I like the competititve enviroment. 

**Edit 2**:

For those who are saying ""HE SAYS HE LIKES THE META AND THEN PICKS JUNGLE GRAGAS, WHAT A HYPOCRITE FILTHY TWAT""

Don't take my words of him being viable, take the words from a british Diamond 1 jungler main with a successful youtube channel called [Foxdrop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-lfrVwExbc)

**Edit 3**: [Busted!](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2s9lcu/the_dont_play_ranked_on_the_weekends_post_from/)

 Funniest part is how I got an angry mob at my back investing like an hour in this post. You can think what you want, I couldn't give less fucks. I gotta say doe, people are not angry because I lied. People are angry at me because I lied about some issue that everyone hates and made it to the front page within hours. Best part is, I lied about the matches, but the point of my post stays true, basically because of all the people that said I was right. Anyhow, hope you have a nice day! 

Oh, and by the way, there is one more fun thing. The post that calls me a liar is actually some kind of witch hunting and induces to hateful speech. Now look at the 4th point of the subreddit rules.

Yup. You guessed it. Masturb...Jk

I queued up SSW and SSB matches and watched them. Lots of them. I learned a little Korean even!

I wanted to know what literally everybody was meaning when they were talking about  this perfect execution, the unbeatable team, this guaranteed 3-0 against all competition. I wanted to know why it was GG c9, GG TSM.

I looked at picks and bans, I looked at warding habits, I looked at laning abilities, I looked at team fighting.

And there is no doubt both of these teams are outstanding. A+. I saw a lot of trust, I saw a lot of expounding on strength. A lot of outplay of top tier competition.

And I saw a lot of weakness. I saw a lot of misplay. I saw a ton of solo laners leaving nexus without wards. I saw bravado, miscalculation of opposition summoners, and mistiming of objectives (based on backs).

And I will firmly stand my ground in this prediction: if TSM and C9 lose 0-3 to the Samsung's I will cosplay bunny riven ala Oddone.

Reasoning.

1. OVERHYPED, more so than I've ever seen in a competitive scene for any game or sport. This is not the 1980 ice hockey USSR vs USA, this is not David vs Goliath. This is 2 outstanding teams against 2 very very good teams. None of these 4 teams are 1 trick ponies. The difference? Underdogs have no pressure, no pressure 0-0, 0-1, 0-2. What happens if the home team somehow loses 1 game ? The pressure builds. 


2. At least 1 Samsung will lose to an NA team, and ""analysts"" will have some 'splainin to do.


3. I believe if I were strategizing against one of the Samsung's I could tilt a certain person and win the series alone off of that. If I were C9 I would look into that. I believe if I was strategizing against the other Samsung I would look very closely at how much fog of war ends up in certain areas of the map...its solo que.

Downvote me, criticize me, make fun if both TSM and C9 go 0-3, but after 40+ hours of watching these teams.....

I know this weekend is going to be competitive.

Edit: Just because this is getting so much hate, I wanted to emphasize out 4 things:

1. Self posts do not gain karma, So I do not give a fuck if you down or up vote this, if it is front page or obliterated. You have all in PM or in comments told me to kill myself and worse. So who is the better man?

2. It is funny watching people with Alliance flair saying that TSM or C9 cannot ""take a game"" off of a Samsung team when .. too soon? LOL

3. I am not going to post a single detail of anything specific in this thread, ever. I hope that the NA teams have done their homework. I am not providing that information in public forum BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO WIN. But the point is that this is not fucking some junior varsity high school football team against the Dallas Cowboys as all the ""analysts"" make it out to be. The matches will be close.

4. I will Cosplay Bunny Riven (Or anything upvoted to be a better option) if I am wrong within 72 hours of the final C9 game. PS:

We apologize,0,3cbnuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/3cbnuu/we_apologize/,2503,1436204078.0,"We screwed up. Not just on July 2, but also over the past several years. We haven’t communicated well, and we have surprised you with big changes. We have apologized and made promises to you, the moderators and the community, over many years, but time and again, we haven’t delivered on them. When you’ve had feedback or requests, we have often failed to provide concrete results. The mods and the community have lost trust in me and in us, the administrators of reddit.

Today, we acknowledge this long history of mistakes. We are grateful for all you do for reddit, and the buck stops with me. We are taking three concrete steps:

**Tools**: We will improve tools, not just promise improvements, building on work already underway.  Recently, u/deimorz has been primarily developing tools for reddit that are largely invisible, such as anti-spam and integrating Automoderator. Effective immediately, he will be shifting to work full-time on the issues the moderators have raised. In addition, many mods are familiar with u/weffey’s work, as she previously asked for feedback on modmail and other features. She will use your past and future input to improve mod tools. Together they will be working as a team with you, the moderators, on what tools to build and then delivering them.

**Communication**: u/krispykrackers is trying out the new role of Moderator Advocate. She will be the contact for moderators with reddit. We need to figure out how to communicate better with them, and u/krispykrackers will work with you to figure out the best way to talk more often.

**Search**: The new version of search we rolled out last week broke functionality of both built-in and third-party moderation tools you rely upon. You need an easy way to get back to the old version of search, so we have provided that option. Learn how to set your preferences to default to the old version of search [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search#wiki_enabling_legacy_search).


I know these are just words, and it may be hard for you to believe us. I don't have all the answers, and it will take time for us to deliver concrete results. I mean it when I say we screwed up, and we want to have a meaningful ongoing discussion.

"Blizz, I'm finally mad.",84,41ub38,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/41ub38/blizz_im_finally_mad/,737,1453296233.0,"Let me preface with my bona fides:

* I started on Blizzard with WarCraft I and have played every Blizz title except WoW and Diablo III.
* I've been playing Heroes since alpha, every mode, extensively, every day.
* I have three Heroes accounts and have spent a decent bit of cash on each.
* I make a point to regularly discuss the game with players at the top of Master League.
* I have never shitposted about any Blizzard game... until today.

Let's review the state of the game.

* No balance patch in over **TWO MONTHS**, *AFTER* massive scaling changes that totally rebalanced every hero in the game.
* Serious, ongoing information lag in notifying users of upcoming new content (e.g., we **still don't know when the balance patch is coming**).
* After all that silence and all those player requests for info, a bullshit *question mark* (!!!) for empty hype-train purposes, instead of actual concrete word on what's ahead for the game.
* Announcement of a huge amount of money to be thrown into tournaments with no sign of similar commitment of resources to features *actually anticipated by the community* like Arena, clans, map editor, *the fucking emote wheel that got ""temporarily"" removed a while back* (remember that, guys?), etc.
* **FIVE** of the last six hero releases (Rexxar, Artanis, Cho'gall, Lunara, Greymane) have all come out **severely** undertuned and competitively near-unusable. (And Medic started pretty crappy and has only come into her own after the scaling changes.)
* Per HOTSLogs winrates, *TWO-THIRDS* of heroes are currently below 50% winrate. Fourteen heroes are below 46%, which is equal to the ENTIRE roster above 50% winrate. The game has calcified into a narrow range of OP picks with everyone else getting short shrift. And remember, Blizz saw this starting to happen after **November** and has sat on its hands since then.
* The Recruit-a-Friend fiasco where dedicated players who'd already recruited for Blizz got fucked over and had to make smurf accounts in order to grind out the most anticipated mount in the game.

I'm sure I could come up with more given a few more minutes to steam, but I think this is quite enough for starters.

Blizz, this is **NOT** good game management. This is **NOT** good treatment of your consumer base.

I've carried a LOT of water for Blizz over the years. I've sold a lot of friends on Blizz games, and defended a lot of Blizz games against what I felt were unjust criticisms. Blizz, I am the epitome of the customer you want. I follow your games for years, I spend lots of money on them, and I defend them to my friends.

And you're fucking. Me. Over.

Stop. Please.

I love this game. I love Blizz as an idea. I understand a lot of these things are being pushed by corporate and not the dev team per se (love you devs, I'm sure you're doing the best you can with what you've got, my ire is largely directed elsewhere). But we can't go on like this.

* **Get on a fucking schedule.** Sorry, but Soon(TM) doesn't cut it with a MOBA. We need to know when heroes are coming out and when balance patches are expected.
* **Cut it with the fucking cloak and dagger.** We understand software development is not an exact science. Let us know what you've got in the works. Don't drip-feed us information that we have to beat out of you.
* **Don't treat your player base like a bunch of fucking chumps.** Focus on what the community asks for. Give older players a chance to buy / grind out incentives for newer players.
* **Test new heroes better pre-release.** There's no excuse for Greymane's W bug not getting caught and fixed before he came out. There's no excuse for the myriad of horrendous glitches that affected Rexxar upon his initial release. There's no way you didn't know Lunara was going to be seriously underpowered. You've done pretty well on a long string of releases in the past (e.g. Sylvanas, TLV, Leoric, Johanna), so I know you can get it together again.

I still love you, Blizz. I'm mad, but I love you. Let's make up. Let's make Heroes greater than ever before.

Tagging /u/Trikslyr and /u/Spyrian because c'mon, guys, we deserve some answers.

**EDIT:** Lots of talk about tone. I'm passionate about the game and really unhappy with some of the decisions made about it lately, but you guys are right -- honey catches more flies than vinegar.

"[SPOILER] Not a witchhunt, not personal hate, not trash talk. But we need to have a frank and serious discussion about Doublelift.",16,1te2pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1te2pc/spoiler_not_a_witchhunt_not_personal_hate_not/,645,1387624991.0,"*This post was deleted when I first put it up, under the title ""I'm probably about to lose all my karma for this - but bench Doublelift"", so I've amended the title somewhat. The text is completely the same.*

Dramatic, drastic?

OK, first of all, absolutely none of us have the experience of running an org as big as CLG - unless Reginald is reading this - but I do have experience in running one back on CoD (60% of people reading this post just disregarded it) and I remember taking the decision to bench star players. We particularly had two, one of which was as mouthy as Doublelift for the same confidence reasons I assume he has (i.e. it boosted his own confidence) but when benched, the team was way better for it. We actually got our Golden Age era team out of it.

I put it to you that the FPS genre matured away from carry players around a year into LoL's run, and LoL matured into it this year.

This will be inevitable with any game, as the roster for players leans away from prodigies and those there from the start and instead becomes saturated with up and coming talent. The market is now filled with amazing potential, untapped, for example Pobelter who was strung along by Curse but EG have proven to be more than capable.

When thinking about this whole situation, I like to think of Pobeleter as the anti-Doublelift. The kid has school, divides his time, isn't in the business of talking trash yet performed obscenely well. Doublelift has an entourage that now includes Montecristo and isn't performing.

So here are my points.

1) **Doublelift is part of a meta that doesn't exist anymore - the carry Gods.** Each game has a period where they exist. CoD, BF, CS, WoW, LoL. But they are becoming less and less relevant. SKT T1 shows us this. Faker is a carry God, but Piglet most impressed me and I'm sure many others with his solid consistent play, and Bengi's pink ward spam carry jungling was the deciding factor in many games. These guys aren't winning because of Faker - they are winning because they are 5 Solo Queue gods in one, something every team should be.

2) **Doublelift is now the unofficial captain on the ground, and forgets commander HotshotGG's orders.** This is speculation to an extent. I do not know the politics of CLG but it seems to me, as with everyone, that after Montecristo's strategy shows the slightest flaw, CLG default to feed-the-Doublelift. As mentioned above, that just doesn't work anymore. Whether it is Doublelift making these calls or not, removing him removes the temptation for whoever IS making this terrible call. You have Montecristo for a reason - his plans WILL work. Maybe you see a hole somewhere, but there is a gigantic whole in feed-the-Doublelift. It doesn't win.

3) **Doublelift is a liability now.** Remember the All-Stars? I do, because that was the first ever League of Legends tournament I watched. Yes, I am this new. Doublelift Penta-killed EU and I was all sads, but respectful. Then I heard his trash talk and I was still respectful. I did this a LOT in CoD and so did many others (not in the screaming console way, we were PC, which is pretty dead now). it's good for fans, hype and is healthy if used in the proper context. It threads a story. However:

* **Doublelift was praised heavily for his laning ability, which Xpecial claimed to be almost perfect.** He has not won lane hard, with any sort of consistency, for ages. This is not hist strength anymore.

* **Doublelift's mechanics are not the best anymore.** Sometimes they are great, but then he's as good as many Chinese, Korean and even NA ADC's are. They are not out-of-this-world anymore. This opinion will get me a lot of hate, but we all watched worlds.

* **Doublelift does not carry the strategic potential (lol) that other ADC's have.** Again, his laning was praised heavily, his mechanics too, but his awareness is sub-par. Always has been.

Doublelift is a liability more than anything. He was a star player back when the meta revolved around players like him in S2, but even then I suspect HotshotGG having in-game control over him proved useful.

4) **He doesn't just let down the fans, he makes them feel ashamed.** This was never more relevant than now. I'm an EU player and an EU fan but this was actually heart breaking. I couldn't bring myself to do the post-game trash I usually do on Twitter, because I can see where fans are coming from.

Doublelift is known for his trash talk, and I said it was healthy - in context. I think EU players get it, since eSports was big-ish over here even prior to league. If I trash talked, it was about bigging ourselves up. Striatus is practiced, we know what we're doing, etc. Doublelift and alot of NA players just go at the opponents flaws. For a region so far behind right now that is not the right attitude. But the worst is when it comes back to hit you in the face.

Doublelift, do you realise how much worse you make it for your fans? It isn't even about getting their hopes up - it's that you insulted their friends teams, their friends favourite players, their friends big hopes. And then you vindicate them. You put your fans in such awkward positions. You managed to make so many EU players mad with your comments, comments your fans had to defend. What do you think happened afterwards?

If nothing else, if Doublelift is kept, if his gameplay doesn't change at all and CLG delve further and further into the unknown abyss of non-existence. Please, PLEASE just change that aspect. Big yourself up, yes, fine, OK, you are a God. But don't set yourself up to get Rekked just to throw your fans in the worst positions. It's shameful.

**Conclusion**

None of us will ever have something as big as CLG have. The few people here who recognise me know we only had up to the tens of thousands of followers. You guys are literally into tens of millions. But fundamental issues exist that are plain for everyone to see.

This is simple. The playbook has been laid out for you. The backlash as already occured. I am of course talking about Chaox.
It will not be the end of the world, it will be a necessary event. This time, fans will understand because they have gone through this before, seen others go through it, and TSM ended up pulling it out and winning.

CLG need to let go of a lot because a lot isn't working. But it's not as difficult as it looks.

That's just my two cents. I await the hate I'll inevitably receive from his bigger followers, but hopefully we can have a good discussion about this matter, because it needs to be had.

Remember when every single new skin wasn't 975 (Or higher)? Remember when Riot released festive icons that we could easily obtain? Then remember when they stopped doing that and started charging 1500IP and 250RP?

Then remember when they stopped charging the IP and left the 250RP?

Everyone wants to say ""Oh it's just an icon."" Or ""No one makes you spend money on this game, you can play free if you want."" But this isn't about the content. It's about Riot making a promise, it's about Riot saying and confirming something, and then completely going against it. It doesn't matter how large or small it is. A broken promise is a broken promise.

Tombstone spawns zombies from illusions, and if you ever got into a situation like this, a swarm of zombies will arise from because of the illusions, which it shouldn't. Also zombies don't disappear when the illusions die, that's why always a horde of zombies are chasing you.

http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=50383
I know that everyone experienced this, even after Undying became popular. Zombies from Tombstone always chase, even you go into the Fog of War. The problem is that they do not lose vision of you and still chase you. They should die once you go into the fog of war.

Zombies in Dota 2 stronger because of an existing bug, compare to Dota. Deathlust debuff of one zombie stacks instead of refreshing the duration (it should only stack with the debuff of other zombies). This means that zombies slow the hero more than intended and deal more damage.

In Dota, whenever Undying was under Flesh Golem, a unit/dying in it's AoE, you would see a dead skull flying towards Undying. Yes that is the heal. In Dota Flesh Golem's heal has a projectile with a speed of 600, while in Dota 2 it's instant. This is why Undying can sustain so much in team fights and makes him hard to kill.

Another problem with Flesh Golem is that Undying heals too much from the intended. Not only Flesh Golem's heal is instant in Dota 2, but in fact it heals to much.

I hope this reaches the community. It's not about Undying being nerfed. It's about the existing bugs that make him so strong.

"After years of rebalancing, it finally feels like League has come to a place where all roles can carry.

Now when an enemy support or a jungler gets a kill, my first thought isn't ""hah nub should have left that for mid or adc"" because they are about as likely to carry as anyone.  Sure things aren't completely perfect, and never will be, but I've played this game since beta and this is the healthiest I've ever seen the game in terms of making all players feel important and impactful when they play well.  Carrying is no longer relegated to just 1 or 2 roles by default.  You don't get to be the carry just because you called a role in champion select.  Now if you want to carry you have to earn it.

Sharon isn't the one who paid for LMQ's food. Please stop this circle-jerking.,130,2brchu,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2brchu/sharon_isnt_the_one_who_paid_for_lmqs_food_please/,199,1406352397.0,"I do feel bad for Sharon but people are spreading false rumors.

She did not pay for their food. I don't get why anyone would think she did. Do you know how much it would cost to feed a group of 5 young males? A LOT. She was a manager who was hired. She had nothing to ""invest"" in the team. 

People seem to be linking

http://www.gosugamers.net/lol/news/27570-rumors-suggest-tian-ci-financial-troubles-prevent-uzi-joining-lmq

which says ""She has been paying for other things such as food herself.""

If you read it over again carefully, you will realize that ""she"" is the LMQ owner's wife, not Sharon.



Also people are quoting:


""Sharon’s friend responds that they are trying to keep up by participating in small tournaments, teaching in LoLClass and eating mainly take out or on the hospitality of Sharon.""

That sentence isn't saying that she paid for food. It's just simply saying that she cooked for them.

Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads.

TIFU - Shark Touch Tank Accident -NSFW,139,4vdw36,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4vdw36/tifu_shark_touch_tank_accident_nsfw/,266,1469911352.0,"So to start with, here's the obligatory ""this actually happened about 4 weeks ago"". Using a throwaway because some people here know me.

4 weeks ago, it was a friday night, I had just turned 19 and my friends and I were going to go spend the night partying to celebrate. One of my best friends works at the local aquarium and the plan was to meet up with him there after he got off from work.

So we get there around 8 pm after the place has closed and he says we can chill out inside while he finishes a few last things. The aquarium has one of those touch tanks where you can pet stingrays and other cool sea critters so we hung out there while we waited for him.

Now I had been to other aquariums before and seen touch tanks but this one was definitely unique. It was very large and has a ton of different species. Everything from hermit crabs to flounder to even a few small sharks. We started poking everything we could, probably giving half the creatures PTSD but once we saw the small sharks we forgot about everything else. There were two. Each was about 2 feet long. They were swimming around in slow circles like sharks do, like they were hunting for something.

Interestingly, they didn't really react when we touched them. They just kept on swimming as if nothing had happened. So since they weren't reacting that much, we started daring each other to do crazier and crazier things to see if they would react. This is where things went wrong. I should probably add that we had pregamed a little so we weren't completely sober.

It started with one of my friends tangling his hand in front of the shark, first for just a instant and then for longer and longer. Then my other friend upped the anti by sticking his tongue in the water. This guy is probably the craziest guy I know. About 5 years ago we used to be really close but we have since drifted apart. But for old times sake, I had called him up the day before and asked him if he wanted to hang out.

So what was so crazy about sticking his tongue in the water? Well he had just gotten it pierced that afternoon and it was still a little bloody.

Now, I know you probably now think you know where this is going, but I promise, you don't.

So he sticks his bloody tongue in the water and the sharks IMMEDIATELY stop their slow circles and start heading his direction. We all start yelling at him to get his tongue out, but he's just laughing maniacally like the joker and tonguing the water like its a girl. He waits till the last instant, till the sharks are about a foot away and then he stands back up. He then looks at me and said something like ""your turn!""

Well I had just been called out. Any other time, I would have laughed at the ridiculous of the situation and gone to see what was keeping my friend but like I said, we had been pregaming and I was not thinking straight.

So I did the only thing I could think of to top that. I waited till the sharks had swam a little ways off, unzipped my pants and dropped my dick in the water. Your birthday, in front of your friends, is not the time to start acting like a pussy right?
So I kind of twirl it around in the water, waiting for the sharks to circle back around and get close. My friend has waited till they were a foot away, so I felt I needed to wait till they were maybe 8 inches away.

My dick is kind of stirring of the bloody water and the sharks sense this and start heading back. They get closer and closer. Suddenly, when they're about 15 inches away, my other friend who were waiting on walks back in. In that instant, I looked up and the sharks lunged for my dick. One shark actually ended up biting into the first one, but the first one got almost its whole mouth around my dick.

I won't go into the gory details except to say that I had always heard on TV that shark's teeth are curved backwards to make it impossible for prey to escape and the TV was not lying.

At the hospital, my foreskin was so shredded that they ended up just cutting it all off.

Four weeks later, [this is what my dick looks like](http://imgur.com/a/nbESD)(3 pictures)

TL;DR: Get drunk and stick dick into shark touch tank at aquarium. Dick gets bitten by shark while distracted. ",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-07-30 15:42:32

At least 25+ free things Riot gives us that they didn't before. Literally MILLIONS of $$,0,31u4dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/31u4dz/at_least_25_free_things_riot_gives_us_that_they/,382,1428466182.0,"[Bull. Fucking. Shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/31t2ng/oce_player_calling_riot_out_on_their_bullshit/) Riot won't say it, but I sure as hell will.

##Riot **IS** giving us tons more stuff than ever before ***for free* when they could've sold it for massive $$**, but players just take it completely for granted!

All the while we bitch and moan like this, and they say nothing. They just take it and choose to keep giving us better, cheaper, FREE things which makes us complain *more* and demand *more* and yet they keep doing it!



* Have you ever gotten a free, completely awesome skin just because it was the World Championships or because you successfully hit Gold for the season? **FREE AWESOME SKIN**, not some ""shitty recolor"" - 
* Have you ever been to a gaming convention where Riot is? They give out tons of awesome [role-specific **lanyards**](http://tagatuci.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Role-Lanyard.jpg) (which lots of people took ALL FIVE of), PLUS (often multiple) free **skin-codes** for you and friends, plus [HONOR **PINS**](http://images.ttcdn.co/i/product/300/0/95745-5061f77abbfb4ca2a23df3a670b0f480.jpeg), plus tons of banana/bomb/cupcake/poro **stress balls,** plus **T-shirts** of all types, plus role-specific **bracelets**, - hell, at Worlds when I went they gave us FREE [**COLLECTIBLE EZREAL STATUES,**](http://36.media.tumblr.com/5209827c28e29f6c422c1f5dde678ecb/tumblr_mu80etsoEK1rn3500o1_1280.jpg) the quality kind, probably just because they had money to burn so they decided to give it to *US*! And guess what? *All that free swag sells for insanely inflated prices online.* They could make a TON of money from it if they were greedy.
* Riot gives out FREE PRIZES for tournaments via simple sign-up, and last time I checked they *increased the amount of free RP given out*! (A sum of at least **$1,250 worth in RP spread across 25 players** *PLUS* a free tournament exclusive-skin for every single tourney (even if it's TINY w/ only 8 teams)! And, they help handle disputes of un-fairness when they are involved, and help promote/market these events, etc FOR FREE.)
* Edit: People are missing this. Riot did put **tens of millions of dollars** into **eSports productions** years ago and for years at an extremely high risk. 5, 6, 7 years ago do you think any investor would truly believe that a game could sell out US stadiums, bring in millions of int'l viewers, show up on TV channels, turn into a whole other sport, etc....? No, or else other people would've done it too. LoL is not the first competitive game... & there was a definite chance that this went horribly wrong. It's great that it worked out and it's profitable now, but holy crap last time I looked watching the LCS, looking up team stats, VOD's, extra pro vids/events/exposure/interaction, etc. is still free lulz. *Why?* Because they're not greedy, they do want to do something fucking awesome for the players (because they are players too), so they poured this money in hoping someday it would pay off. Oh and last time I checked they give out **millions in prizes** during Worlds--don't tell me they *HAD* to give away that much money.
* They have ***increased* the quality** on new champions and skins, often simultaneously **lowering** the prices. Compare Bard vs. Sivir
* They let anyone use their **Intellectual Property** for FREE, so long as it's ALSO free! Holy cow, it's like Riot wanted really cool shit to be free for everyone! Besides, have you *seen* Etsy? Tons of people *DO* use their IP for profit, against their will, and yet they are not prosecuting or threatening to sue every person, just to make it stop.
* They try so hard to give the community ways to shine, doing **interviews**, **news videos**, **summoner spotlights**, creative **contests**, etc. all at costs to them with no real profit (cooking and art contests, professional-looking videos, etc.), giving out prizes like **pricey electronics** on top of a hoard of RP.
* They do awesome things like the **URF-Itational videos**, the **dressing up,** the **effort in the accents**, the video clips of **ham going into servers**, the **art,** EVERYTHING, *FOR BLOODY FREE*!
* They are completely re-designing all of the older champs, cosmetically, gameplay-wise, and more. FOR FREE. WHILE they continue to provide REGULAR content (new champs, skins, etc.). How do you justify that, if Riot is greedy? Trust me, people would play and buy old champs even if they were not completely overhauled.
* Did you notice that you get new animated champion/holiday-specific **login-screens** with custom **music** *all the time, for free?* That definitely didn't exist way back when.
* They actually **update *old skins*** to increase the quality of them to match what they're putting out now. Think Morgana's particles!
* Ever been to the weekly LCS studio? These games happen *weekly* and yet they continue to give out ridiculous amounts of **free stuff**. I guarantee you that the $15 price to get in could be easily turned to profit by ebay'ing what you got.
* Did you notice that if you buy the URF **chibi figure** you get another random one *FREE*? Do you really think they had to do that to be profitable...? No. They could've made it half-of, even. But they made it FREE.
* Did you know that they often send free Teemo hats, T-shirts, **swag**, etc. for FREE to new community groups in countries where LoL is just starting to bud, just so that they can encourage it to grow?!
* They offer *more* and *more* content for free like **custom summoner icons** just for being good or because of the season, or just because you ""mastered"" a role, *just because*... Wait, no, they can't make any money off of that.
* *LOADS MORE,* because this was literally just what I could think of by memory, off the top of my head!

Of all things, Riot did not do this out of *laziness* or *greed.* If they were greedy, they would not do recolors--their time is much better spent on things that are much more profitable and important. Also, have you considered that maybe they have to price them this way because the time that a Rioter spent on this (even if ""easy,"" [but ask any professional, it's not](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/31t2ng/oce_player_calling_riot_out_on_their_bullshit/cq4udti)) could've been spent on something else much more profitable? But maybe, just maybe they thought it would be an awesome-enough customization that it's *worth taking the hit* in production, *just because they want to give us what we've been asking for.*

---

TLDR; Riot gives us ***A SHITTON of free stuff***, more than ever before, ***literally hundreds of millions of dollars,*** but it's taken for granted. The more they give, the more players beg & complain & just expect more. *But they still keep giving.* 

**If you don't like it, just don't fucking buy it. After all, they give out enough free swag that you really don't have to.**
  
Edit: /facepalm Somehow people missed the point I was making, I probably said it poorly. No problem with disagreeing with pricing, quality, free stuff as marketing, etc and so forth. But don't act like anything you consider ""easy"" or ""small"" should be given to you for free right NOW, or else Riot is horribly screwing over every player intentionally. ... If this is the case, all summoner icons should be free, some of the low quality skins should be free, some of the low quality/underplayed champs should be free, some of the simpler ward skins should be free, etc. cuz IMO they were easy to make, are small things, and it doesn't cost Riot anything to make them free.... Why aren't people rioting about that? O_o

---


BTW, Why I don't think Chromas are ""easy"" to make (just an example):

* Riot team meet to decide which champ to recolor, what colors to choose
* team meet to decide who has time/free workload/skills to do this recolor, artist + web/marketing + engineer + tester(s), can't be the same guy every time because boredom
* artist has to stop/pause/halt current projects, emails, etc to start recolor
* (artist/engineer/web/mktg/tester gets interrupted by email, or pre-scheduled meeting, or other (trust me), has to pause + resume)
* artist finishes, creates [pretty presentation graphic](http://www.newsoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/resize-1.png)
* artist sends grfx to web/marketing team, new textures to engineer
* web/marketing write post for PBE release, uploads grfx, etc.
* editor reviews post for PBE release
* engineer codes package into the store
* engineer sets up texture
* engineer/tester tests all 3 recolors
* team meet/announcement to make sure every1 knows about this (support, PBE staff, etc.)
* web/mktg/community mgr public PBE release announcement
* engineer posts store pkg/texture to PBE 
* community finds out some mistake was made, or they want dif. colors, or jagged edge looks ugly
* support/PBE/community mgr evaluates what to tell player base, promise fix, etc.
* team meet/announcement to decide which recolors to fix, which to leave, etc. again who to assign
* artist fixes
* engineer re-uploads
* web/mktg/community mgr respond that it's fixed
* testing is good so it goes from PBE to live via patch.
* MASSIVE stress testing, potential bugs discovered, more complains/fixes/changes requested
* support has to field 100's of tickets on the things above like ""can u switch the colors around""

**Article V.**

In the tradition of our forebears, thou shalt uninstall, for it is thine fault that we now taste defeat. Indeed, thou art a carry most lacking in skille and I hate thee with all the passion I have previously reserved for mine lover. I suspected that I should have selected Tristana while I was engaged in instalocking Evelynn. In conclusion, good sir, go and fuck thyself with a rusty spoone.

**Article XII.**

Thou shalt lock a role other than what thou hast declared, forcing thy teammates to scramble for a new consensus in under fifteen seconds. Thou shalt remain silent during their panic.

And when, in the sight of thine Champion Portrait, thine allies are weakened or slain, thou shalt sound loudly the horns of retreat, lest they neglect to run like fuck.

I don't know where to start from since I'm very upset and want to kill myself right now.                          
I was about to sell my alpha set for money (1350$) and this money would really help me...                          
They just took it, the discord admin was supposed to be a middleman.                                  
I gave the middleman the items, they proceeded to ban me from discord so now I don't know what to do.                       
guys I need some help, my life just turned upside down ...                         
chat with markydooda: http://i.imgur.com/VwopBnQ.png                                
marky proceeded to a discord call with me while I was crying he was laughing, he finds this whole scenario amusing that he is using his name to stomp on a nobody like me.                                         
i will kill myself tomorrow and the blood will be on his hands                                      
the discord admin currently has the alpha set and he refuses to give me back.                             
help me guys, you are my last hope                             
                                       
edit 1:formatting 

edit 2: this is not a debate whether or not he did it, marky has scammed me and he is proud of it, he is not even denying it. help me show him that even that I am a nobody, that does not give him the right to stomp me. alone I am nothing but together we can face him.        
marky's profile: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070673430/

edit 3: I appreciate everyones support, I never imagined it would come to this point. about sfex - marky's excuse to scamming me is that his friend got scammed by a known scammer (which is an entirely different steam account) so in his eyes it's okay to scam me if his friend got scammed. I have nothing to do with his friend, I haven't heard his name nor talked to him.                            for those of you thinking I am overreacting, you don't know what it's like living week to week, being in debts. I was counting on this $, I needed it. all marky did was act as if he were to buy it just to scam me, I don't care what excuses he has to ""justify"" scamming me, I don't know why he picked me, maybe it was because I was the only guy selling the complete set at the time on discord but he used his name in the community to ruin me, then straight up laugh about scamming me on discord.

This subreddit has an issue with using the downvote button correctly...,33,3r75kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3r75kw/this_subreddit_has_an_issue_with_using_the/,231,1446462787.0,"Hey there. In this community, we all try to get along, we all have our differences and opinions. That's one-hundred percent fine. In fact, it's what makes this subreddit an interesting place to be in.

However, a lot of the users of this sub need to learn how to appropriately use the downvote button. Let's take a look at the the downvote button, and what it is and isn't.

I frequent the 'new' and 'rising' sections of this subreddit, just to see if I can help out any new or unsure players in their Destiny journey. The fact that anyone can ask a question is excellent, and is the reason this subreddit is reputed for being nice and friendly. However, if within 5 minutes a post is at a 33% amount upvoted with zero comments, there is an issue with the userbase.

The downvote button is not a disagree button. It is not something you use in a debate with difference of opinion. It is not a tool to bury a question posed by a new player. In fact, in the comments on any post here, hovering over the downvote button will give you the text box 'Does not contribute to discussion.'

This shouldn't need to be explained, but here's an example anyway. If someone has made a post asking about good Crucible Pulse-rifles, and someone comments ""I like turtles,"" then that can be downvoted (although because of the current use of the downvote button, it will probably stay). If someone comments ""I prefer the Nirwen's Mercy over The Villainy,"" and you disagree, you **cannot downvote this**. It is inappropriate use of the downvote system. Commenting your opinion is fine if you disagree, this is how discussions with other human beings work, for example ""I actually really think The Villainy beats the Nirwen's Mercy in every aspect,"" is a fair comment due to opinion. Just because someone does not look into hidden Aim-assist values, archetypes and dps numbers does not mean they are liable to be downvoted into oblivion. Please use the downvote button appropriately, not as you see fit, because what you may see as fit may not be how it is supposed to work.

TL;DR - The downvote button is used to lower posts that do not contribute to a discussion, not because you disagree or are feeling petty. Please use it appropriately.

EDIT: Hey it's getting early over here in Middle Earth. The points are having an interesting battle of attrition, but I need sleep. Thank you for sparking the discussion here, it's been great. Once I'm awake I'll continue to participate in this thread. I read all the comments here tonight, it's really been great (in an observant way). Thank you.

EDIT 2: I awake, not caring about the amount of upvotes, but see that half of the comments are made either in jest for very ironically. Clearly the point has not gotten across. If I could make a Reddit-wide PSA to not downvote everything you see I would, but thought my most frequented sub could use a reminder. Both happy and disappointed with this sub this morning.

Regarding the minute silence at the Liberty Stadium,101,22xnlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/22xnlj/regarding_the_minute_silence_at_the_liberty/,574,1397409516.0,"Bearing in mind that all games this weekend kicked off 7 minutes later than usual in commemoration of the Hillsborough disaster, I do not feel that Chelsea have any excuse for the behaviour of their fans today.

After a delay a day a timely announcement of the stadium sound system, our minute silence today was overruled by Chelsea chants coming from below the stands in the away concourse, with a least a hundred people not coming up to their seats. This was a respectful moment not only for those who died in Sheffield, but also for a young boy who died this week in Swansea. 

~~Your fans and your club should be ashamed.~~ **PLEASE READ ADDITIONAL EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION.**

**Edit:** At the time of writing, this post stands at 18 upvotes and 17 downvotes. If you downvoted all of my comments without having been there or having anything reasonable to the contrary, I consider you an enabler and a disrespectful piece of shit, because I don't know why else opening a dialogue on the issue needs to be hidden so badly. I don't care if you don't like it, because I can guaran-fucking-tee you that the families of people that we were trying to pay respect to today would have liked what happened today far less.

**Additional edit:** The majority of Chelsea fans respected the moment impeccably and did nothing to deserve scorn. I am not pointing the finger at every Chelsea fan, merely stating that as footballing communities we need to deal with the anti-social behaviour among ourselves. By being ashamed, I mean that Chelsea fans should feel a need to make sure that they make their feelings on such behaviour vocal, and not turn a blind eye to it, as must we all in such incidents at our own clubs. Being ashamed does not mean feeling like you are to blame, but rather that you can do something to try and help it by distancing yourself visibly from such actions in order to show others that it is not acceptable.

**Final edit:** The general theme of posts coming through to my inbox at this point is a mixture of 'everyone picks on Chelsea' and 'OP you are a crybaby'. Well done, you've really shown how sensible you can all be in a discussion. And that's without talking about the block downvotes currently going on in the comments.

Subreddit Ruling: Richard Lewis,928,33g6xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/33g6xs/subreddit_ruling_richard_lewis/,5422,1429685488.0,"Hi everybody.  We've been getting a steady stream of questions about this one particular topic, so I thought I'd clear some things up on a recent decision we've made.

For the underinformed, we decided late March to ban Richard Lewis' account (which he has since deleted) from the subreddit.  We banned him for sustained abusive behavior after having warned him, warned him again, temp banned him, warned him again, which all finally resorted to a permaban.  That permaban led to a series of retaliatory articles from Richard about the subreddit, all of which we allowed.  We were committed to the idea that we had banned Richard, not his content.

However, as time went on, it was clear that Richard was intent on using twitter to send brigades to the subreddit to disrupt and cheat the vote system by downvoting negative views of Richard and upvoting positive views.  He has also specifically targeted several individual moderators and redditors in an attempt to harass them, leading at least one redditor to delete his account shortly after having his comment brigaded.

Because of these two things, **we have escalated our initial account ban to a ban on all Richard Lewis content**.  His youtube channel, his articles, his twitch, and his twitter are no longer welcome in this subreddit.  We will also not allow any rehosted content from this individual.  If we see users making a habit of trying to work around this ban, we will ban them.  Fair warning.

---

As people are likely to want to see some evidence for what led to this escalation, here is some:

>https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/590212097985945601

We gave the same reason to everyone else who posted their reaction to the drama. ""Keep reactions and opinions in the comment section because allowing everyone and their best friend's reaction to the situation is going to flood the subreddit."" Yet when that was linked on to his Twitter a lot of users began commenting on it and down voting this response alone, not the other removals we made that day.  Many of the people responding to the comment were familiar faces that made a habit of commenting on Mr. Lewis' directly linked comments.  That behavior is brigading, and the [admins have officially warned other prominent figures for that behavior in the past](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1iqdc4/civilized_discussion_and_levelheaded_moderation/cb7eaul?context=1).

>https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/588049787628421120

This tweet led the OP to delete his account, demonstrating harm on the users in this subreddit.

>https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/585917274051244033

After urging people to review the history of one particular user, this user's interactions became defined by some familiar faces we've come to associate with Richard's twitter followers.  (It isn't too hard to figure out.  Find a comment string with some of them involved and strange vote totals.  Check twitter for a richard lewis tweet.  Find tweet. Wash, rinse, repeat.)

>https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/590592670126452736

I can see three things with this interaction.  Richard tweets the user's comment. Then the user starts getting harassed.  Finally, the user deletes their account.

---

Richard's twitter feed is full of other examples that I haven't included, many of which are focused exclusively on trying to drum up anger at the moderating team.  His behavior is sustained, intentional, and malicious.  It is not only vote manipulation, but it is also targeted harassment of redditors.

To be clear: **TheDailyDot's other league-related content will not be impacted by this content ban.**  We are banning all of Richard Lewis' content only.

Please keep comments, concerns, questions, and criticisms civil.  We like disagreement, but we don't like abuse.

Thanks for understanding and have a good night.",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-04-22 01:51:28

What is happening in this subreddit?,4,5a09xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5a09xt/what_is_happening_in_this_subreddit/,393,1477745038.0,"I am fairly used to the overbearing amount of troll negativity on this thread, but since this August 27^th event, it has been just stupid. The first day after, I scrolled down the entire first page of submissions, and not one substantive or even neutral submission could be found. I think that's pretty sad, because hate or love what they did, it certainly warrants an interesting discussion. 

Here are some of the genius points that made it to the top of the heap: 

* **I cannot plug my iPhone 7 into my new MBP:** That is as relevant as saying I cannot put my diskette into my electric shaver. That is neither mind boggling nor weird. The last phone that needed to be plugged into a computer was the iPhone 3G.

* **Apple priced me out, I am switching to Microsoft and getting a Surface Studio:** Never mind that Apple was always on the upper end of expensive, this one is truly mind numbing. First, inflation adjusted this is far from the most expensive MBP Apple has offered, but that is not even scratching the surface. The cost of ownership of Apple laptops has been shown over and over to be very competitive. Lower maintenance costs, high life expectancy and high residual values actually have made Apple laptops often cheaper than much of the competition during the time of ownership. And just as a side comment, the Surface Studio is more expensive than a MacPro, like twice as expensive than a 5K iMac and makes the new MBP look like Apple priced it to compete with the Raspberry Pi. 

* **Touch Bar is like the most gimmicky thing ever:** These must be the same people that complain about touchscreen phones. I mean it is just astounding that in 2016 people violently defend the notion of static function keys over an intelligently adaptable, multi touch screen. When I type a Zip code on my iPhone, I am glad when I get the NumPad keyboard and **NOT** the QWERTY, and on the flip side, I still get mad when I have to type in my credit card number and get the QWERTY keyboard. It's annoying. That is why digital keyboards on smartphones are genius. Smartphones can display the appropriate keyboard for the task! That makes sense and very shortly after 2007 has become the universal standard. If you want to go back to a BlackBerry Pearl (not a bad phone, by the way) you can, but I like multi-touch screens with adaptable software that uses the bottom 50% of my phone more intelligently than simply having static, plastic keys like in an old ass BlackBerry that can never change, and never adapt to anything. This is no different with TouchBar. Sure, typing is better on a physical keyboard, at least until haptic feedback is a little more advanced, but the function keys are surely an obvious place to start reclaiming a lot of real estate and making it smarter. It's not quite like reclaiming the bottom 50% of BlackBerries back in the day, but that is still a large strip of computer that is now inarguably superiorly used. You can still have the TouchBar mimic your old, static function keys, but to also make it this totally adaptable interface for the software you are using is actually really smart and the demos only showed a first attempt of what developers could do with it. This technology will absolutely make life easier and better. 

* **Nothing in Apple integrates anymore, nothing just works:** The usual example cited is that you need a dongle for something. I mean in a time when I can start writing an email on my iMac, continue on my iPad when going to the bathroom thanks to continuity, copy a relevant picture I find on my iPad, paste it back into the email on my iMac after my defecation without skipping a beat and in the meanwhile iCloud has synched every file, every contact, every Wifi password, every other password, my calendars, to-do lists, photos, videos, music, and made freakish backups of all of my devices that even restore the very website I was on to find that picture while pooping with my iPad should I have accidentally dropped the iPad into the toilette and destroyed it, requiring a new purchase, the statement that nothing works together in the Apple ecosystem anymore is just wonderful.

I know C9 and FNC are in the same group but I hope they both make it out. OG is looking amazing and CLG can still make it out of groups pretty handily, It'd be awesome to see 4 western teams in the final 8.



Edit: yes I made a shitpost 8 days ago that called NA a wildcard region (the post was mostly about tsm tbh). I'm saying EU vs NA is dead now, not 8 days ago. Also the reason I even thought to post this was when i realized that i was happier C9 went 3-0 after being told they would go 0-6 than if FNC had gone 2-1.

Froggen said they had a ""sh$#tty mentality"" and says that he understands now why it ""all went downhill for them [Liquid]"".

This was about an hour after Adrian (TSM Picaboo) fed hard in bot lane and afk'd from the game (this happened on Valkrin's stream). Valkrin felt compelled to report him (ofc probably won't do anything). 

It's just really annoying to see LCS players who can't even handle soloqueue. I see this kind of crap all the time in silver, but never expected to see it from the pros. I think it's telling that both Valkrin and Froggen were salty enough to report/mute these players. If you watch either of their streams, you will see these guys have a very strong mentality and are not easily swayed by the stuff that happens in solo queue. Very disappointing.

Piglet and his supp give up, froggen mutes them: http://www.twitch.tv/froggen/v/23573899?t=273m45s From this point on they just die over and over.

Adrian getting reported for afking: http://www.twitch.tv/valkrin/v/23544990?t=248m30s 
He afk'd and came back a couple times if I remember so I am just going to source the report.

Btw, Piglet was out of the game less than a minute. Dunno how the idea he was getting ""ddosed"" started but even if that were true it wasn't much of a ddos. Still doesn't justify what he did as the reason he gave up was because the rest of the team didn't group with him when he wanted (froggen alludes to this himself).",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-11-02 12:02:37
New Lava Based Champ Scoria,226,31ihr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/31ihr8/new_lava_based_champ_scoria/,652,1428235726.0,"Only got a picture of his E: http://imgur.com/5YNaPfk

he doesnt use mana, uses a new resource called magma which is simialr to energy

his q pretty much fires a beam of lava and hits first enemy champion and gives em a scorched debuff, you can recast q to dash to anyone with a scorched debuff ( it dashes to one person and if another person has the debuff it jumps to them automatically ) 

his w has a passive that lets u do bonus dmg to enemies w/ socrch debuff. 

his w active knocks all enemies around him back and pulls them back slowing them for 40/45/50/55/55% 

his ult rapidly shoots out lava, the number of shots depends on how much magma you have

his ult has no cooldown but u need to have a required amt of magna for it to activate

Fanworks Fridays! Share your League of Legends fan art and writing or show off the artists and authors you love!,0,359dty,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/359dty/fanworks_fridays_share_your_league_of_legends_fan/,164,1431061458.0,"[Hey friends and welcome back to Fanstuff Friday!](https://i.imgur.com/IKvKJnM.png) (image courtesy of /u/QDesJardin)

This is a place to share all of the work you've done or found around the internet in the past week with art aficionados like you.  Cosplay, fan art, literature, stuff you baked, this is all allowed in Fanstuff Friday, **as long as the subject of the piece has to do with League of Legends.**


**This week's theme is BEST FRIENDS FOREVER!** 

Let's keep the creativity going!   

Same rules apply as always:

----

* Anyone can post anyone else's art, however you must fully credit an artist's where possible.

    If we find you taking and rehosting other peoples' work, we will be really disappointed in you. If it keeps happening, you might earn yourself a ban. Be respectful to the people who created the work you're sharing.

* Art must be a serious attempt, your [5 minutes in MSPaint drawing Teemo](http://imgur.com/a/Jyz6c) doesn't count. (Even if the examples are amazing.).

    But this doesn't mean you have to spend hours just to be here in the thread. /u/John-C-Greystroke [drew this in 5 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/pmIAVdN.jpg). Just try to show you put forth an effort here and don't troll our thread.

* Art is subjective. Not everyone's going to like every piece of art, and that's fine.  Criticism and discussion on pieces are welcome and encouraged. Just don't be a jerk about it, and we're cool. 

    That goes both ways, too. Artists and writers, if someone doesn't like your work, don't let it get to you. Everyone needs to get along.

* All art must be **Safe For Work**. No posting nude drawings of champions, that belongs in /r/rule34lol. (NSFW) If it's racier than official splash art, it doesn't belong here.

***

**But will I be able to share my creations when the Friday thread's not up?**

Of course! Our rules haven't changed; you can post your work anytime, as long as it's within subreddit rules. 

**How can I find a picture I saw in a previous week?**

You can find all of our past threads by using this [search string](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/search?q=Fan+Art+and+Literature+Friday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).
 Now, let's get to sharing!

**Where can I go for more fanworks here on reddit?**

Well, you can try these:

* /r/ImaginaryRuneterra 

* /r/loreofleague

Why can't I ban a champion the other team doesn't own? Bans aren't just against the enemy team...,149,2dic3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2dic3z/why_cant_i_ban_a_champion_the_other_team_doesnt/,785,1407990480.0,"This is especially true when a new champion comes out. I am not a fan of watching people play the new champion immediately in ranked and as first pick I ban those champions. In fact often times I'm banning champions that I do not want to see on my team rather than champions I don't want to see on the enemy side.

My question is why can I not ban a champion if the enemy team does not own that champion? I don't want to watch my top lane Gnar go 0/5 and rage quit in my promotion match. Why can I not ban a champion away from my own team?

EDIT: To clarify, in order to ban a champion an enemy player must own said champion, else it cannot be banned.

EDIT2: People are whining that I'm the asshole who bans their called Teemo jungle/whatever niche pick you want to play. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. I want to ban Gnar so my team can't feed with it, I want to ban Kassadin because my teammate thinks he is super OP despite never playing him etc. Pick all the Teemo jungle you want, I'll be requeueing in 5 mins.",controversial_subreddit,1,2014-08-13 23:28:00
Riot Devs said some very disrespectful comments to Adam Harrington in latest Ryze Podcast,621,4t9388,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4t9388/riot_devs_said_some_very_disrespectful_comments/,869,1468750356.0,"""Guy from the street, nobody"" Adam Harrington gets some major disrespectful comments during this podcast by developers who I feel should had already known this mans legacy for this game and the backlog of work he has done in the gaming industry. Adam Harrington voiced 5 champions in this game one of his being the iconic Shaco and has been respected by the League community for a long time. When they discuss Ryze old VO at 4 minutes in they don't recognize Adam as a real actor and was a nobody. I feel like Riot should educate their employees more on who have worked with them in the past because Adam is a great actor and showed a lot of passion even when given 7 lines for the oldest Champions in this game. For me this shows just how Riot really doesn't give a damn anymore about others outside of their bubble and forgets that without Adam, without every person who collaborated with them or were hired by them League may have never been what it is today.

"They might have an impressive client, but...",488,3a6dvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3a6dvw/they_might_have_an_impressive_client_but/,2125,1434557566.0,"I used to be a full time DOTA2 player. You know why I switched? It wasn't because LOL had a better client.

DOTA2 is pedantic about last hitting. If you're not animation cancelling, you're going to have TERRIBLE CS. Last hitting on every single champion is radically different due to radically different missile speeds, swing animation speeds, etc. 

Death timers are insane and walking back to lane takes twenty years. You have to pay gold to be able to teleport (""back""). 

In League, almost every champion has skill shots. In DOTA2, only a few heroes do. Most are point and click abilities. And you don't even get to use them much. Why?

In DOTA2, mana is so restricted there are some champions that can use one spell every five minutes or so in the early game. Have fun with that.

Yes, DOTA2 has a great replay system and you can spectate a game and hear official commentators (in tournaments) over voice chat. That's awesome. But League of Legends beats DOTA2 in gameplay.

EDIT: For those saying I left because I sucked, I wasn't great but I wasn't terrible, more average than anything at around 3400 MMR and mained Invoker/Faceless. I dislike the pedantic nature of last-hitting because the game puts such a HUGE emphasis on it.  I feel like laning in LOL is more of a duel and less of a last-hit mini-game.

EDIT 2: Scroll through the comments being written by people that play DOTA2 and you'll get an idea what a wonderful, welcoming, nice, and warm community is waiting for you over in Gaben's paradise. 

EDIT3: So here's a reply to the several hundred people saying ""3400 is shit, you didn't have fun in DOTA2 because you didn't *get it*, you need to be top 10% before you understand the game at all."" If your game is a shitty experience for anyone not in the top 10%, then you've proved my point. The game has to feel good for even the lowest 10% of your player base. Of the ten or so players I invited to DOTA2, none still play. You shouldn't need to be good to have fun playing a game, so thanks for proving my point. 

EDIT4: Sven's base mana at level one is 182. Storm Hammer uses 140 mana. His mana regen is 0.57 a second. At that rate, it takes 245.61 seconds to regenerate the mana one Storm Hammer uses. That's 3 minutes and 56.6667 seconds to regenerate the mana of ONE spell.",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-06-17 11:12:46

Wave of Violence in Israel and the West Bank,0,3rxvjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/,553,1446936213.0,"There has been a recent wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories.  Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  

As a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.  Please discuss the issues and the comments made, not the persons making them.  If you find comments which violate our rules, you’re encouraged to use the report button or alert the mods via modmail so that we can investigate.

ESAM on Smash Summit Drama,0,4cb7q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/4cb7q0/esam_on_smash_summit_drama/,751,1459186840.0,"First off, mods, don't delete this, this is actually me. Instead of going to a thread that is mostly hate comments, I would rather answer questions/doubts this way instead of reading through dozens of people blatantly shitting on me for no real reason besides favoritism.  
  
&nbsp;  
  
ANYWAY, LET'S GET STARTED!!  
  
&nbsp;  
  
First off, let's go over the qualification process to get into the Summit 2. Becuase of the whole Mememan situation last year, they didn't want just ANYBODY to be able to opt in, so you had to either top 32 at G3 or Big House, or be on the MIOM top 50. I lucked out SUPER hard at Big House in my bracket because Drugged Fox lost to Ginger the round before he had to play me, so I got to play Ginger instead (And beat him). That put me into top 64 Winner's, where I lost to Dark Atma (Sheik), beat my SFL friend Rula (Falco) in Loser's to advance to top 32 where I lost to Zhu, thus me being qualified for this event.   

&nbsp;  

Did I get lucky? Of course! But that's how brackets work and, as we say when people SD, we take those. I didn't rig the brackets, I didn't poison Drugged Fox, I didn't kick him in the balls to make him play bad, he just lost and then I got the better end of the bracket for it.   

&nbsp;  

Now, let's talk about how I GET my votes. Obviously I have a huge pull in the Smash 4 community being one of the top figureheads and ALSO a top player. I have a large following stemming from that. But...here's the thing.   

&nbsp;  

*These people watch me regardless of the game I play.*  

&nbsp;  

Wait, what was that ESAM?  

&nbsp;  

*These people watch me REGARDLESS of the game I play.*  

&nbsp;  

When I tweet that I'm on a Melee stream, a PM stream, or a Smash4 stream, they will come watch to support me because they enjoy ME, the player ESAM, and not just my Pikachu in Smash4. They aren't just fans of my Pikachu, they are **FANS OF ME**  

&nbsp;  

This is SUPER important because it isn't the ""Smash 4 community voting for ESAM,"" it is ESAM's *fans* voting for ESAM. Which is the same as PPU fans voting for PPU, or Drugged Fox's fans voting for Drugged Fox. I just have a unique advantage of my fans typically not wanting to vote for anybody else because they are primarily Smash4 viewers/followers. I don't have to worry about people that are like ""Oh man I like Hax so much but I also love Lucky's fox oh this is so hard"" because I have grown a brand and a persona on the internet (And at tournaments) that people want to vote for me for the sake of voting for me, and there really isn't any competition in that. So I got a lot of nominations that way, and also a lot of votes.  

&nbsp;  

""Pfft, ESAM's only getting votes because he has perks for voting""  

&nbsp;  

Oh, you mean like Zhu saying he would cosplay at Summit last year and also him making a Vlog about it? Or when Kage pledged allegiance to Melee Hell after the whole mememan debacle to 1) show MH that they were gonna be represented and 2) to gain from it personally. Or how about HugS that had his whole chart thing of perks for the days he was still in. But nah, just because I'm doing it it's messed up, when it is actually more beneficial for all the people voting for me because...I'm actually helping them get better.  

&nbsp;  

I make a LOT of Youtube videos to help people get better. I am currently making an in-depth Pikachu guide for Smash4, I have made videos of a ""Deal With It"" series where problematic moves/characters are broken down and shown how to beat/maneuver around them. Hell, the first one of those was AGAINST PIKACHU, I just want people to get better, and this is no exception. Of course I am in it for personal gain as well, which leads into my next topic.  

&nbsp;  

I doubt anyone actually read my Smashcapps article if they disliked me since ""ESAM is just a Smash 4 faggot who supports women"" or whatever the fuck people think nowadays on reddit LOL, so let me break it down for you.  

&nbsp;  

I started playing Smash competitively in 2005 with Melee. I was 12. I got better through practicing with my training partners, and unfortunately they weren't the better players in SFL (Seibrik and I led the pack, but I was the best of the group). I would win against the best people in SFL including Linguini, Lambchops (aka BeerMan), QDVS, Rock Crock, etc etc. Literally everyone in SFL except for DaShizWiz, but AFAIK I only played him once and it was at like...my 3rd tournament. I was on the SFL PR and I was, IMO, at least the 3rd best Samus at the time, potentially behind Wes and HugS (Although me being the egotistical little shit I was said I was the best). 2008 comes along and Brawl comes out. My training partners stop playing Melee to focus on Brawl, myself included, and we get really good at that game. Melee kinda dies in SFL and so even if I **wanted** to play Melee I didn't really have access to it. I play Melee at a couple of big Florida majors, FAST1 and Winterfest, and did pretty good (At least at FAST1, I got 13th). Afterwards I focus on Brawl way harder and it ends up yielding great success in 2010 and on as I became a national threat and blah blah blah nobody cares about this because welcome to the melee community.   

&nbsp;  

I wanted to start taking Melee more seriously around 2011 because I was already established in Brawl and I obviously really enjoy Melee, but I went to college in South Carolina which had a total scene of like...9 people, who I was SIGNIFICANTLY better than due to my history playing Melee and my Brawl fundamentals. So I was boned there, and obviously I spent more time focusing on college and occasionally attending Brawl tournaments to make money so I could eat food LOL. I went to a lot of North Carolina tournaments that ran both events, and I consistently placed 2nd under PPMD, or Dr. Peepee as he was called back then, or even occasionally I would lose sets to Twitch, but I was pretty much the 2nd best player in NC behind the god himself. Either way, I didn't have the resources to just travel up there for weekends to practice because I had schoolwork and going to tournaments in the first place put a huge strain on my time, so it was at MAXIMUM a once a month thing.   

&nbsp;  

So the main point of that shpeal was that I have had pretty much 0 opportunity to actually train in high level Melee...ever. And yet I still do pretty well at majors, especially at recent months. I have taken relevant names over the course of the past few years, such as Javi one year after he took 4th at Apex, I had beat Chillin/Nintendude at a Xanadu when they were relevant, I have beat Alex19, Alan, Squid, The Moon, Redd, and a whole slew of other people...with no consistent training partner or way to get better besides studying matches.  


&nbsp;  
When I'm at tournaments I typically enter multiple events and so at the end of the day I am super drained from exerting mental energy CONSTANTLY for like 10 hours, I don't really want to play friendlies after playing all day non-stop. I got knocked out of Smash4 relatively early at Big House (9th) and I actually felt not tired so you wanna know what I did? I played a bunch of friendlies with the NorCal guys. It was doubles, but it was actually practice with other good Melee players....for once. It was nice, and it reinvigorated my drive for Melee, which was one of the reasons I got 5th at Tipped Off (As well as Drugged Fox AGAIN getting upsetted a round before he plays me to Drunk Sloth, the Orlando ICs player. Don't worry, he finally got to me yesterday at Tiger Smash and 3-1'd me in WF and GF).   

&nbsp;  

I was actually getting into Netplay and playing it with good people I knew, but I live in off-campus housing still and my community switched to wireless internet that has no ethernet access, so it is very inconsistent. This not only affected my ability to stream and not randomly crap out, but it VERY much affected my Netplay abilities, which sucks because I actually really like netplay, but am unable to really utilize it.  


&nbsp;  
This is why I want to go to Summit so bad. I would absolutely LOVE to actually get dedicated Melee practice with really good players because I never have and yet I STILL am relevant. A lot of top players respect me and support me in this endeavor (Hbox, MacD, Drugged Fox, just to name a few) because they want to see what I can do with actual Melee practice.   

&nbsp;  

Am I gonna go 0-2? Very statistically probable, But like...everyone that got voted in last time (Kage, Swedish, Alex, Zhu, SFAT, and S2J) went 0-2 or 1-2 (Because 6 people can't go 0-2 in a 16 man bracket), with SFAT being the ONLY one to win a 1st round game....so me going 0-2 wouldn't even me unprecedented because players that **you, reddit** deem MORE WORTHY of being there....also shit the bed. It's also incredibly high level competition so going 0-2 losing to players like ARMADA and then later like S2J would be completely reasonable for ANY player, regardless of if they were 13th in the world or currently 81st in the world (And the only reason I'm so low is because I had a smash hiatus for like 3 months at the beginning of 2015 and then focused on Smash4, where I ended up top 8'ing CEO and EVO, worth, and then the first Melee major I attended was Paragon, in *september*).  

&nbsp;  

Honestly, I don't even care if you want to vote for me or not, but at least dislike me for actual reasons and not for some bullshit that you read one time and have kept spewing out, like Reddit is prone to do. So now that that's out of the way, let's go to some evidence people will use against me.  

&nbsp;  

""But ESAM, you tweeted here  https://twitter.com/PG_ESAM/status/710641866140729349   that you don't actually care for Melee, what the fuck is up with that?""   

&nbsp;  

So, here's the thing. I am a very PR person, ESPECIALLY on my new twitter, because esports and panda and just....generally it's not a good look to be an asshole/fuckhead/someone who just blatantly doesn't give a shit about appearance on...one of the main social media platforms that exist today. BECAUSE OF THIS, I didn't really want to incite a whole Smash4 vs Melee debate on my twitter (Kinda happened anyway, oops) by giving my ACTUAL reason of ""The Melee community online is an incredibly hateful, spiteful, and overall shitty group of people that I really don't want to blatantly hate me more than they already do for being a Brawl/Smash4 player and the words I had for them after Apex 2015 when they CHANTED MELEE DURING THE FUCKING AWARDS CEREMONY FOR THE OTHER GAMES AFTER DOING IT AT 2014 AS WELL."" I actually alluded to this in https://twitter.com/PG_ESAM/status/710640886661713924 and I don't think it has QUITE got this far, or at least I haven't read anything like that yet.    

&nbsp;  

So yeah, I was trying to save face by lying and getting people to vote for Wobbles because at the time I didn't really want to get involved in it.   

&nbsp;  

Then I changed my mind because y'know what? Fuck you guys, I'm doing this not for you to like me, but for me to get better so I can actually get good at the game I love 2nd most (Next to Smash4). I am doing this Summit so I can get better and enter more Melee events and do well and learn and get better and actually get **HIGH LEVEL PRACTICE which I have *NEVER HAD ACCESS TO IN MY ENTIRE CAREER!*  

&nbsp;  

""But ESAM you spend more time on Smash4 than Melee"" No fucking shit, I'm a top Smash4 player and Smash is my job at this point and Smash4 is more lucrative to me. I make way more money playing Smash4 than Melee, so obviously at this current point in time I am practicing it more, if I didn't I would be a fucking idiot. Just yesterday I won ~800 playing Smash4, then like ~350 playing melee and ~240 playing PM. See which number is the biggest? Yeah, no shit.   

&nbsp;  

I am planning on more Melee streams in the upcoming weeks, some with Cohenski (The best SC player besides myself) but I'm not even sure if I have the cords for my XCapture 1 so it may just be an analysis stream. I will be going over Drugged Fox's probably at some point after or before Fusion 3 for an all-day training session because I'm finally out of school and I have the luxury to travel for practice now. Will I make it a consistent thing? IDK because streaming/making Youtube videos is also a big part of my career and both of those are EXTREMELY time consuming, not to mention my relationship which I obviously invest 1-2 days a week to see her.  

&nbsp;  

So listen, I am not here for you to like me. I am not here to get your votes because I doubt I have suddenly changed enough people's minds that it will actually matter. I am here for you to at least dislike me for the right fucking reasons, which is.....honestly I don't know. I'm a pretty good person, I help a lot of people, I genuinely care about both communities (Although Smash 4 more since is isn't as...awful to me), and I care about both games. Hate me for taking votes away from some other player or something, idk.  

&nbsp;  

But the thing is I'm not even doing it because I am raising a lot of money and attention to Summit from people that wouldn't have been invested to it in the first place. THOUSANDS of dollars have been used in the shops by people who are voting for me. I and my fans have helped support the Shine and Summit shops more than literally ANYBODY ELSE, and if it weren't for me that money wouldn't be there.   

&nbsp;  

If you want to vote for someone else, do it, support them, be awesome. Make them beat me. I am not doing anything unfairly, I am not cheating, I am just playing my cards correctly. If you hate me for that, you better have at least hated Kage for the MH thing and Alex for using Mango's fans to get there/HugS last year for using incentives/Zhu for using incentives and you better not have supported Mememan because that's probably the MOST hypocritical thing that could be happening rn. Are there people voting for me strictly because they like drama? Probably. Some have tweeted at me that they want ""Salty melee player tears"" but, again, we take those. I don't support what they are saying, but I can't make someone not feel a certain way.   
  
&nbsp;  

There has been a lot of wrongdoing in the community on both ends, and I understand a lot of the bitterness the non-Melee crowd has with the Melee crowd. It is seen as very closed community that is SUPER tight-knit and people that try to break the mold or fit in often get seen as bad people. Kinda like what is happening to me right now. It wasn't always this way, as 2 Brawl players, or rather, 2 players that were SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER at Brawl than Melee, then went back to Melee at some point and are now respected in the community. Those 2 being Mike Haze and Fiction. It's one of the reasons me and Mike are so cool with each other is because we've known each other for 6 years now, meeting for the first time in the MLG era of Brawl. Zero was respected in Melee when he was putting a lot of time into it, but now I feel like if he tried to go back into it, they would give him shit. But I fucking BET you that if a top Melee player were to give smash4 a try, it would be open arms. Oh wait, that's already happening with Wobbles and Hungrybox. Larry Lurr is a multi-game threat, Wizzrobe is a multi-game threat (Who the Smash 4 players love, btw), M2K, Zero, and I are all multi-game threats, but somehow I'm the one with no respect because I am the best at Smash4 and I spend more time on it? Even though Larry does that too? And I'm sure if he started taking Melee more seriously again they would be like YO LARRY IS BACK not ""Fucking ESAM trying to get into the Summit""  

&nbsp;  

So again, if you are going to do anything with this thread, at least shit on me for a valid reason...which you probably don't have any...because I'm kinda godlike. Am I as good as the other players that are in the voting phase? Not all of them, but I feel like I could beat SEVERAL (PPU, Drugged Fox if I played him again, The Moon (again), HugS, Duck, Alex (again), Javi (again), and Hax). It's not like I haven't done well at majors before, so it isn't like I am some random that is infiltrating the system. I barely didn't top 8 Beast, I top 8'd Tipped Off, I got 25th at Big House, and I got 17th at Paragon LA. I am a good player, significantly better than 99.9999% of people hating on me.   

&nbsp;  

So yeah, I guess that's it. Buh-bye~  
&nbsp;  
Edit: Another instance of random Melee hate by people that they don't perceive of being ""In the community"" is all the shit that TKBreezy got for his commentary at 5gods. His commentary was pretty good, but people were literally shitting on him non-stop, and it wasn't even constructive, it was just ""Go back to smash4"" when he originally started commentating Melee, then switched to Brawl, then to PM, and now he is a super popular Smash 4 commentator.

[A plea to Valve] Please don't kill the honest Autoexec users,182,4kzld1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4kzld1/a_plea_to_valve_please_dont_kill_the_honest/,934,1464182417.0,"Hello, everyone.

I am loopuleasa, the author of [The Dota2 Core](https://github.com/loopuleasa/Dota2-TheCore-Config-Engine) Config Engine, and I wanted to address a change in the latest [patch](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4kwyyr/dota_2_update_main_client_may_24_2016/d3ijllz?context=3) that stated:

> A key input can no longer be bound to multiple console commands, except when cheats are on or spectating.

&nbsp;

In simple terms, it means that most of the available autoexec binds that were at the foundation of more advanced and user-friendly scripting engines are now dead. This includes the [Dota2 Core](https://github.com/loopuleasa/Dota2-TheCore-Config-Engine) and [Manta](https://manta.dodekeract.report/#/home?_k=an37vc), which were two of the popular ones being used by players worldwide.

&nbsp;

**What is a scripting engine and how are players utilizing them?**

A scripting engine, is a set of txt files that are run through valves Source scripting engine (an engine on top of an engine), using the autoexec file, that can in theory control all aspects of the game UI, meaning you can use it to setup your keyboard in any way you want, a way that is user friendly to everyone, and more customizable than it could ever be through the in-game options menu.

Here are some example screenshots of my super compact layout that is available through The Dota2 Core, that many players were using and I've received many happy responses from it. If you look closely to understand these, you can see that the keyboard layout is switching depending if you have ALT or SPACE pressed, meaning you have two more extra keyboards to utilize in a compact space readily available at the tip of your fingers.

[No modifier keys pressed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loopuleasa/Dota2-TheCore-Config-Engine/master/Dota%202%20Reborn%20Keyboard%20Setups/Loopuleasa's%20Super%20Compact%20QWERTG-DFXCV%20layout%20%28ALT%2CSPACE%20mods%29/keyboard%20layout%20visual%20images/visual_layout_nomod.png)

[SPACE key pressed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loopuleasa/Dota2-TheCore-Config-Engine/master/Dota%202%20Reborn%20Keyboard%20Setups/Loopuleasa's%20Super%20Compact%20QWERTG-DFXCV%20layout%20%28ALT%2CSPACE%20mods%29/keyboard%20layout%20visual%20images/visual_layout_space.png)

[ALT key pressed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loopuleasa/Dota2-TheCore-Config-Engine/master/Dota%202%20Reborn%20Keyboard%20Setups/Loopuleasa's%20Super%20Compact%20QWERTG-DFXCV%20layout%20%28ALT%2CSPACE%20mods%29/keyboard%20layout%20visual%20images/visual_layout_alt.png)

It's so much more user friendly, and it cannot be setup this way by just using the in-game menu.

&nbsp;

**Are these engines considered hacks/macros?**

Absolutely not.

We put great effort into making sure the engine translated one key-stroke into one in-game action. No instances where one button could've launched two separate game actions (not UI actions) was available. Various tricks are being used in the back-end by the engine that supports these advanced functions, yes, but in the end, the user would've still pressed something, and out the pipe on the other end in the game client only one action would've launched.

It's all about where each button is, and in what layout, and how much control you have over it, and how you can customize the placement of all the binds you need for a game as complex as Dota 2.

The in-game menu is not enough.

It's good for most folks, yet people want & deserve better customization of their keyboard profiles.

&nbsp;

**Do you think this solves the hacks/macros issues?**

There are advanced hardware functions for gaming keyboards and mice out there that can easily setup scripts with more effort, and dedicated folks will always try to shortcut their way into achieving something like that. This patch doesn't solve anything regarding that, it simply hurts the average player that prefers to control their game layout using the autoexec.

Not to mention software auto hotkeys and various other macros and tools can be setup within minutes. There's no limit there, and detecting them is a battle with the windmills.

&nbsp;

**Why aren't tournament rulesets only for tournaments?**

Why should average players that want a more user-friendly layout suffer because the rules are so strict in tournaments? 

98% of the players won't ever participate in tournaments and just want to enjoy the game while having full control over the buttons right in front of their eyes, control that is simply not provided by the in-game options menu. And how is that their fault if we just simply ask for more, and we did our own systems using the tools you provided. Why take those tools away when we created something that works better?

I remember having a discussion with DK Phobos a while back, talking about this subject and how tournaments only let you use autoexec if you hand type it on the spot. Doing something like this with something like the Dota2 Core which contains thousand of lines of scripts isn't possible, but it's fine.

Tournaments were not the target of our engine, it was the players out there, frustrated that the simple ""Man, I wish this action was on this button"" need was impossible to do using the in-game menu.

&nbsp;

**There is a need for more customization and user-friendliness.**

You could view us as modders.

Think of games like Skyrim, Fallout, World of Warcraft, Warcraft III, all of them games in which the community had an idea of an improvement, and they took it upon themselves to make it a reality. Look where that led. 

I am reminding you that Dota was a mod in Warcraft III, and it was possible because Blizzard were smart enough to offer tools to the community to play around with. I am sure you are grateful of that fact. You owe the modders, why take away and limit their tools and toys just because other kids around the block are choking on them?

We are the ""Control scheme modders"". Just to make a distinction to the other modders around the steam workshop, that are doing a great job by the way.

People just say ""I don't like the control scheme, I want something better"" and some dedicated people rise up and fill that need and people enjoy it.

Happy times in the end.

&nbsp;

**Do these provide an unfair advantage?**

Let me give you an example.

Think of Legacy binds.

There are players out there that are using Legacy binds and they are fine like that. It's their preference, and it's how they're used to playing. With that in mind, Legacy binds are such an attrocious and convoluted control scheme that they're hardly efficient at all.

The current system available in the in-game menu is miles better in terms of layout and efficiency. That's why people use it and that's why there are hardly any players at the top level that use Legacy binds any more.

Now the next step is a player that uses something like a scripting engine. Where is the advantage there? Is the player circumventing some security in the game client, does he have map hacks or downright cheats?

No.

He just has a better layout.

You can go in the in-game menu now, and put your ultimate on ""P"" instead of ""R"", and your stop key on ""K"" instead of ""S"". That's just an absurd example, but it's obvious that that keyboard layout will be far more clunkier to operate than the classic QWER.

That how us folks feel about the current QWER customization available in the game client menu, compared with the customization of more advanced engines.

People want to have the human-machine interface as low-friction as possible when playing the game. At the end of the day, it's obvious that the player's skill in the game is all that matters.

The control scheme is something that gets in the way, when in reality it should fit like a glove.


&nbsp;

I really hope people at Valve read this and understand that we're passionate about this.

*Me and other people that I've discussed with, now that we've been used to this control scheme are going to quit Dota for now. The same would happen if Legacy keybinds were removed from the game, for example. People that are used to have ""X button"" do the ""Y action"" have it in their muscle memory so much that it takes significant effort to unlearn it.*

It's like drinking the best beer in the world for two years straight, then being forced to drink the cheapest piss-water available just to satisfy your alcoholism. Most people would just quit drinking at that point.

&nbsp;

Thank you for reading.

&nbsp;

Your friendly config guy,

Loop. <3

The Entitlement Has To End,30,3ckzlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3ckzlq/the_entitlement_has_to_end/,435,1436381596.0,"Congratulations, you're upset because a great game isn't as great as you thought it was gonna be, and now Bungie owes you reparations. 

Oh wait, except they don't. They don't owe you anything except for for the game they've made. They don't owe you what you hyped yourself into thinking the game would be. They don't owe you for putting 100, 300, or even 2000 hours into the game, just like Quentin Tarantino doesn't owe you for watching Pulp Fiction for the 100th, 300th, or 2000th time.

But here's the thing: *You don't owe anything to them either*

You know why people say ""Don't like it? Don't buy it""? Because NOT BUYING something sends a much clearer message than BUYING, COMPLAINING on the Internet for months, and then BUYING THE NEXT THING. Take some responsibility for yourself, you aren't beholden to Activision, Bungie, the Destiny community, or anyone else. 

Entitlement is a huge problem with gaming communities in general, and the Destiny one definitely has one of the worst cases of it. 

So for all the people like me who love Destiny, and are on this subreddit in order to share that love with other fans, next time you see someone complaining that Bungie owes them more, ask them: Why? 

Why does Bungie owe you anything? Are you an investor? Are you a fellow content creator or game maker? Did you help in any way besides playing the game they designed? Interaction with art is not the same as contribution, and when it takes time and skill to make new levels, test new guns, and design new emblems it's not right to demand that someone give that away for free. 

Appreciate it when it happens, don't expect it to.

EDIT:
Apparently some people are taking this post as being anti-community feedback, which it is not at all meant to be. 
I'll highlight the difference using a couple of examples by u/decimalator


Frustration: Oh man, this game is great but I wish they had done this and this or this, but not that.

Entitlement: Really? All I get for playing 2000 hours since Day 1 is this emblem? I've already done all this stuff! Eff you Bungie, I want my money back.

Frustration: The crucible is nothing but Thorns and Final Round snipers these days, and auto rifles are terrible now! We need some weapon balancing Bungie!

Entitlement: Why do I have to pay $20 for the emotes, class items and shaders?? Bungie only cares about money!

Frustration: The weapons you get from Variks and even the elementals from Skolas are nowhere near as good as the weapons from VoG or CE, and the drop rate on the elemental primaries on Skolas is abysmal given the time it takes to finish compared to VoG and CE.",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-07-08 13:53:16

Statement regading AVS - ANTIPRO-.,0,3zptt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3zptt4/statement_regading_avs_antipro/,647,1452087854.0,"Hi everyone sorry for the late response! I will explain the situation fully here. 

It came to our attention that one team was trying to win in a unfair manner. 

The admin present decided to disqualify team ANTIPRO-

After the reaction from the community I personally looked into the scenario and this is what I can read from the logs. 

[42:43](https://gyazo.com/a717456acdbd6c7feab68ace9355ecd9) Dragon Knight uses pause. But during this period no one else from dire used the pause. 

[43:58](https://gyazo.com/e820081e6bbaa71d7e767f5e93801596)

Radiant (AVS) Disconnects from the game again. 

The Dire team (ANTIPRO-) Has 4 pauses and do not use any of them.

Gyrocopter and Queen of Pain used phrases like ""EZ"" and nice.

After watching the Replay, when Radiant is disconnected 

Dragon Knight writes ""No pause"" (correct)

But they still have 4 more pauses to use since no one else has used pause before. 

Therefore the decision made will stand. 


EDIT: Radiant didn't abuse pause or spam pause. They paused only once until minute 42 incident and that was Tiny's pause in minute 19 (Which lasted few seconds).
Team Radiant never wasted their pause as many are saying. This is all from Replay and logs which can be checked by everyone.

CMV: It's wrong that Fnatic only have one strategy at a time,31,3pvtla,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3pvtla/cmv_its_wrong_that_fnatic_only_have_one_strategy/,1021,1445589064.0,"When talking about the upcoming KOO vs Fnatic match , Monte has mentioned that Fnatic are good in Bo1 but struggle in Bo5 because they only practice one strategy at a time. Another thing Monte ignored is that Rekkles is as good in hypercarries as he is on utility adcs as we saw on his Jinx games against EDG and on his Tristana games against Origen. 

When EDG tried to attack Fnatic's strategy by picking away Kennen and Sivir , Fnatic were able to adapt and won pretty convincingly .

 It's true that Fnatic struggled during the second game vs AHQ , but looking back at that game , Fnatic were in control during the early game and only really struggled because they were against a hyperscaling Jinx on the hands of a great Jinx player combined with Tahm Kench. It is my personal opinion , but I think Fnatic would have won both games against AHQ if their drafts were different . In the first game they put Huni on a champion he wasn't very comfortable on and in the second game they didn't really have a hypercarry on their team and they were against the powerful Jinx+Tahm comp. 

Even back at the MSI , we saw that Fnatic did very well in the Bo5 against SKT even though the Nunu pick by Bengi cost them the last game.

Rekkles is not some one dimensional player who can only play utility champions. If we look at his history , we can safely say that he can play all ad carries. 

That is my opinion and it's mostly an answer to Monte's criticism of Fnatic having only one strategy at a time. I'm not saying that Fnatic will win KOO, in fact I think they matches will probably be pretty close. ",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-10-23 03:31:04

However as we saw effectively argued these changes were (somewhat) good for the lcs. Here is the problem for 99.99% of the players though: THEY DONT PLAY IN THE LCS.

but, what do i mean? with all the early game nerfs, simultaneously with nerfs to the superlategames of adcs, we see a game of **teamcomps**. whoever has the best teamcomp in the lcs is very likely to win. the problem is, in soloq or normals, you do not get to influence a teamcomp that much. the one guy comes in wanting to play trynd, the other wants to play vayne and the last wants to jungle vi. thats completely ok, but in a game where the most influential thing is teacomps **you lose  your options to influence the game because the game is decided by the teamcompositions picked**.

since people seem to enjoy downvoting me, to all who say that picks do not matter in soloq and you can play whatever you want: if that were so, then why do certain champions have winrates that go as low as 37%? meaning that the lose 2 games for every 1 they win over 100000 samples? i think this proves that you are pretty much wrong, if you happen to be in game with the wrong composition the odds are overwhelmingly against you.

tl;dr: before, the game was decided by the first 10 minutes, which you could influence. now its decided by champ select, which you cant influence


**Please read at least the tldr and do NOT SIMPLY RESPOND TO THE TITLE. THAT IS NOT THE POINT HERE, I DO NOT WANT AMUMU OR MALPHITE NERFS. I am not saying you cant carry.

We are developing an anti-cheat that is better in every single way than any that exist,42,36bpgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/36bpgs/we_are_developing_an_anticheat_that_is_better_in/,564,1431915413.0,"My background is in development.

I run a design, consulting and development company. I am self-taught, but also attended school in order to see if I was missing anything. I wasn't, in some cases, I taught my professors things. I know PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, (among HTML, CSS and tons of random web/LAMP based languages) and have recently been learning C++.

I connected with a friend who specializes in Javascript and Python, and he was able to connect me to his friend who is an expert in all variations of C, among many other low/high level development languages.

He and I had coffee about a month and a half ago. Within two weeks, he and I had produced a somewhat operational base level anti cheat that would allow us, in real time, to detect people using almost any kind of cheat. It is extremely recursive, proprietary and somewhat intrusive, but with my ideas and his know how, we produced a beta version for ourselves.

We got onto a server together (not competitive), and started firing up various cheats, some before we started CS:GO, some after, in many iterations. 

In some cases before they were even toggled on, or in basic terms, while it was gathering information in order to prepare the cheat to be toggled on, our anti-cheat detected successfully 12/16 cheats that we were testing.

One of the other four was detected in less than five minutes, two within fifteen minutes, while one cheat evaded us completely. Come to find out, the final cheat was not even working, thus why we did not detect it. 

That's a 15/15 score, with one non-operational cheat (which, doesn't matter) not being detected.

After we decompiled them, we anonymously sent many of them to various dev teams over the last month or so in order for them to better detect them. We even highlighted routines they should pay attention to.

This is only the start of our tests. 

We plan over upcoming weeks to acquire many cheats, both public and private, both ""detected"" and ""not detected"" by VAC/ESEA, and decompile them to learn more about what makes some of these programs more special than others.

Last week, we were sent a higher end paid cheat. It costs more than $100. I won't list the exact price here, or the name. After a little DRM workaround to run it freely, our anti-cheat detected it instantaneously.

This is a cheat that we've seen multiple people in their forum post statements like, ""Been using this in both PUGs and MM for 6 months, not detected,"" while we were able to almost instantaneously discover its use.  To be honest, most of the cheats are completely basic and the developers are unskilled, but in some cases, these cheats are pretty advanced and made to replicate humans in every way.

This completely undermines VAC and Overwatch, since only some of the most private ones can do this, and VAC only detects listed cheats, and most Overwatch cases won't necessarily convict the better cheaters since the replication is so near-perfect.

The issue is that VAC will not, can not, and may not ever detect many narrowly distributed and privately built hacks. That statement is based solely off the way VAC works in its core, and any more information about that you can dig up on your own.

So, you may be wondering... what are our plans for this?

* I hope that we can create a very small, affordable ($1-3/month or similar) subscription to this anti-cheat

* I hope that we can find a way to partner with the game developers, and manage this using the resources we have combined with their infrastructure

* Hopefully, through this partnership, our software can notify Valve/ESEA or whatever companies partner with us, of detected cheaters

* We hope to find a way to have the cheat do score monitoring and be able to detect statistical anomalies, and run certain routines to detect further undetected or new cheating methods based on detection routines we've written

* In the end, it will require an opt-in, and it's more likely that future games could be built around partnerships and this premise, but we hold hope that we can adopt it into the CS:GO system somehow successfully as well

* If all else fails, we plan on using some of our own servers in order to start a service to use this anti-cheat and provide the cleanest gaming experience for this game to date. This is literally our last resort, and least desired option. We don't want to run a gaming company, we want to help improve the experience, not only on this game, but future games as well.

I appreciate any and all comments and will answer any questions to the best of my ability without endangering our project or the progress we have made. 

I hope that this gives some of you something to look forward to.

Realistically, we're 3-6 months out from testing this with anybody else other than us, because we need to patent and protect whatever we can, as well as make sure that our anti cheat itself isn't backward engineered and can't be evaded easily. We understand that where there is a will, there is a way, so we have enlisted the help of two ex-hack creators and offered to compensate them accordingly to help us protect the integrity of our cheat detection system.

A few notes and pre-answers for some questions...

* I know some of you will be eager to offer help or be involved, we have the team members required for this, from graphic designers to support people already from the infrastructure of both of our companies, but I appreciate your eagerness to help.

* No, I won't post screenshots of the anti-cheat, and no I won't post any of the code/share decompiled code from the cheats we have.

* While we would love to just hand this over to companies like Valve when it's done, our time and effort has gone into this, so the timeframe could get extend to a point where negotiations and infrastructure needs to be created.

**What we would love to hear from you, questions you can answer for us:**

1. Would you pay $X/month for a 99% clean cheat environment?

2. Would you pay a monthly fee to Valve to see it added into matchmaking instead?

3. Would you run an anti-cheat client while running your CS:GO game considering it didn't slow down your system, streaming, FPS, or affect your game?

4. Would you rather this be optional, or required?

5. Does the intrusiveness level of an anti-cheat make you less likely to want to use it?

We have other plans, expansions and iterations of this, a web-based version, and much more. For the time being, this is all I can share with you guys I think.

Thanks again to this community, and I look forward to a cleaner, mostly cheat-free future.

Have a good day guys!

tl;dr - I am a developer. I met a superstar C/C++/C# coder. I love gaming. I love CS:GO. I got to AK ranks started getting cheated more. Pissed me off. We got hands on cheats, reverse-engineered them, sent a few to Valve, wrote anti-cheat. Our anti-cheat kicks ass. This is us sharing our progress with you, and giving you something to look forward to.

If you tl;dr'd this at least go to the numbered questions right above and leave us your thoughts.



**EDIT**: Many people are making this out like I claim to be the best C++ coder in the world. I have just started learning the language, but the person I am working with is not just learning the language. He probably knows C better than I know any of the languages I listed. I appreciate the criticisms, concerns and comments people have made, all good and bad.

I love this community, I hope that we can prove those wrong that doubt the ability of somebody to create something new and functional, just because somebody else hasn't done it yet.  I also never said anybody at Valve is stupid, incompetent or unable. I just think they have a different agenda being tasked with maintaining and development VAC, rather than a client-side more intrusive anti-cheat.

Other people point this as a post to build hype to get donations. You can mark my words, we won't be asking for donations, money, or contributions from the community, unless it's for a functional version of the end service once it's ready to be released -- or once someone acquires the technology and charges you for it.

Once again, the criticisms, negativity, positivity and suggestions are all appreciated, and I think will help us to address certain issues moving forward we may not have previously thought of. One of which is credibility, so we will likely need to find a way to contact some pro players, sponsors and organizations that we can get behind us to instill some faith into the community.

We have a meeting with a company in the Seattle area this week who saw this post and is interested in talking with us and having their developers look over what we have done and the plans we have for the rest of it. I can't promise any more updates. I expected a more positive response from the subreddit honestly, but I'm not entirely surprised either.

Those with feedback and suggestions, both positive and negative, we appreciate it. We hear your concerns. We hear your skepticism. I guess the proof is in the pudding.",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-05-17 21:16:53

I'm disappointed in this community's reaction to the HoT price structure.,0,3a65vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3a65vc/im_disappointed_in_this_communitys_reaction_to/,243,1434554110.0,"I'm really disappointed in the guildwars fan base over their reaction to HoT cost. In my opinion one of the biggest setbacks of established MMOs is the cost to get started.

We'll take WoW for example, if I wanted to get my friend to play it, they would have to buy the following: Most recent expansion ($50), box set of main game and all previous expansions ($20), minimum of one month of game time ($15 online, $30 in store).

That's 85$ online or $100 dollars in store just to get my buddy started. Arenanet or their publisher have made the decision to eliminate all that hassle and trouble and provide the complete GW2 experience in a single box. Players who already own the game buy the same box to upgrade to HoT.

I can get the gripe that $50 seems a lot... but hey I spent over $50 dollars to take my family of four to a movie for two hours... I spent nearly 70$ for most 8-12 hour games nowadays. I spend nearly $400 for my monthly train pass to commute to school and work in the city... 

What I'm getting at is $50 is not a lot of money these days, especially not for a game which many of us will play for 100's to 1000's of hours over the course of a year or two with no subscription fee... 

But I'm not disappointed in the community for griping about the cost, that's fully understandable... I'm disappointed because ""veterans"" feel they deserve something more than casual players. You know what you got? Countless hours of fun in a well crafted, well made world with dozens of updates all free to the player after the simple purchase of a box. I'm disappointed in the community for feeling that Arenanet ""owes"" them something because they're giving new players the original GW2 for free. 

Arenanet is one of the better game-developers out there, they communicate, they listen to complaints and try new things to improve their game. They've been successful in a market dominated by broken promises and a giant behemoth. 

I'm not a fanboy by any measure, currently I'm not even playing GW2 due to other MMO interests at the moment. But I would encourage the community to cut back on their entitlements and to be more supportive to one of the better game developers out there that actually seem to listen to their community's feedback.

GW2 is a good game, but if we force them to start handing out free things or to undercut their prices we're going to see a drop in quality or a drop in frequency and either one of those things will not be good for our game.",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-06-17 10:15:10

At least her damage wasn't touched, but people pick her for her pushing potential and the teamfight power of her ult, not her damage. I honestly can't see her being meta after this.

As if it wasn't bad enough that the ADC has less champions than any other lane, most of them can't even be used because for one reason or another.

-----

First off, let's list off every champion listed as a ""Marskman"": Ashe, Cait, Corki, Draven, Ez, Graves, Jinx, Kalista, Kog, Lucian, Miss Fortune, Quinn, Sivir, ~~Teemo~~, Trist, Twitch, Urgot, Varus, Vayne.

Marksmen who are so bad as ADC, they're better as Toplaners: Quinn and Teemo. And everyone hates them for it. Teemo isn't even an ADC, even though he's a ""marksman""

Marksmen who are sub-par ADCs, so they've become midlane poke-bots: Ezreal, Kog'maw, Urgot, Varus (and sometimes Corki)

Marksmen who are so bad, they're just unviable: Lucian, Miss Fortune. **Edit:** Apparently Lucian is strong in non-LCS regions apologies. I'm not very familiar with other regions.

**So, the actual list of USABLE ADCs is: Ashe, Cait, Corki, Draven, Graves, Jinx, Kalista, Sivir, Trist, Twitch and Vayne.**

------

Off the bat, there are only 11 champions usable in the ADC role, but many of them are just not strong enough: 

Vayne, Draven and now Kalista are feast-or-famine, and are never played in competitive as a result. They NEED to snowball or are useless. Vayne is occasionally played due to the fact that the pros can justify picking her with their mechanics, but even still, she can still be very easy to shut down.

Ashe, Cait, Graves and Twitch aren't bad, but they simply aren't strong enough to survive or deal reasonable damage, due to one flaw or another. Ashe is the strongest of the 4 by a longshot, but she is a utility ADC, and was nerfed pretty harshly twice in a row since her rework, and really hasn't been seen since. Twitch barely escapes Miss-Fortune tier on the merit that he does rarely get picked, and generally does well when he does.

This leaves us with the current ADCs being used in pro play pretty much every game. Corki, Sivir, Jinx, and Trist. And even Jinx and Corki are sometimes considered weaker picks if their team doesn't accommodate for them.

This isn't to say there's no variation in ADCs, we still do see the occasional oddball pick from the 11 good ADCs, or an AD Kog'maw, but the point is that sivir may be a strong champion, but it's not because she's strong, it's because **every other ADC in the game is so weak, that you can have an ADC that lacks damage, but has a strong utility ult and not be punished for it.**

If Season 4 Trist still existed, there wouldn't be any problem. Pick S4Trist, don't get greedy with midgame fights, get the S4Trist nice and fed and punish Sivir's lack of damage late game with an extremely safe hypercarry. I mean, we sort of see this with Jinx, but because she's immobile until she gets a reset, she can still get dove by the sivir-ulted frontline. If Twitch or Cait were stronger champions, they would use their range and slipperiness to punish and hypercarry the game.

But nah, just nerf sivir. Its just a sivir comp, you group and win right?",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-07-25 07:22:13

Click to hear about some of the things that have been keeping us busy. #2 will blow your mind.,3103,4x35a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4x35a3/click_to_hear_about_some_of_the_things_that_have/,2944,1470848482.0,"I would like to share some of the things we have been up to since we last chatted.

On the product side, we’ve been busy. Both our [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps have had [multiple releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile), and we’re proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we’re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.

We’ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we’d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We’re still in the early days, but I’m happy we’re dedicating resources to it.

As it relates to monetization, we’ve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we’ll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don’t want to compromise what’s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.

Yesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we’re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We’ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.

We’ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we’ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We’ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.

Happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.

#National Poll of Polls and Projections

**Poll of Polls**

Poll of polls are averages of the latest national polls.  Different sources differ in which polls they accept, and how long they keep them in their average, which accounts for the differences.  They give a snapshot to what the polling aggregates say about the national race *right now*, to account for outliers or biases in individual polls.  

We have included both the 4 way race (4 way), and head to head aggregates (H2H), as they are presented this way in most polls.

Aggregator|Clinton %|Trump %|Johnson %|Stein %|Net Margin

[Pollster/Huffpo (H2H)](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton)|48.3 |41.0 |N/A |N/A |Clinton +7.3

**Projections**

Projections are data-driven models that try to make a prediction of a candidate's prospects *on election day.*  They will incorporate polling data to give an estimate on how that will affect a candidate's chance of winning.  Note:  The percentages given *are not* popular vote margins, but the probability that a given candidate will win the presidency on election night.

^(* Fivethirtyeight also includes Now Cast and a Polls-Only mode.  These are available on the website but are not reproduced here.  The Now Cast projects the election outcome if the election were held today, whereas Polls-Only projects the election on November 8th without factoring in historical data and other factors.)

^(** Sam Wang's Princeton Election Consortium includes both a ""random drift"" and Bayesian projection.  We have reproduced the ""random drift"" values in our table.)

The NYT Upshot page has also helpfully included links to other projection models, including ""prediction"" sites.  Predictwise is a Vegas betting site and reflects what current odds are for a Trump or Clinton win.  Charlie Cook, Stu Rothenburg, and Larry Sabato are veteran political scientists who have their own projections for the outcome of the election based on experience, and insider information from the campaigns themselves.

#Daily Presidential Polls

Below, we have collected the latest national and state polls.  The head to head (H2H) and 4 way surveys are both included.  We include the likely voter (LVs) numbers, when possible, in this list, but users are welcome to read the polling reports themselves for the matchups among registered voters (RVs).

Don't lie about me to my boss,9,3dkare,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/3dkare/dont_lie_about_me_to_my_boss/,43,1437088994.0,"This happened around 2001 when I worked for a computer company that decided to start offering web hosting.  Since the project was one of the top initiatives of our CEO, he took a very keen interest in how his pet project was going and was very responsive when anyone emailed him about any and all difficulties.  While that's usually a good thing to do for customer service, it's often not so great for the poor sales guy that gets that one customer that has issues with everything.  So on to the story..

I was working in my cube farm when I got a call from a cheery young lady looking to propel her boss' company into the information age and was looking to see what we could do to help her out.  M - Me.    CG - Cheerful Girl (for now)

M: ""Hi this is JoetheOK, how can I help you?""  
CG: ""I need web hosting for my company's website and I'm not sure where to begin""  
M: ""You've come to the right place, let's see what we can do to help""  

So that's probably not the exact wording but I do always try to be helpful to my customers so that's the general gist of the start of the conversation.  We went on to talk about our facility, how things work, the pricing and a lot of other Q&A.  In all, it took about 30-45 minutes to get everything sorted out and make her a happy camper when we ended the call (this is called foreshadowing).  She said she needed to make a couple more calls and then give everything to her boss but I should hear from her in a day or so.

Fast forward a couple of days and I hadn't heard from her so I figured I'd give her a call and find out if she was ready to go.  I actually got her on the first call (rare for sales) and at that point, we'll just call her PG for Pissy Girl because nothing that came out of her mouth during this conversation was nearly as pleasant as our initial call.  At first, I thought I'd actually gotten her evil twin but then came to the conclusion that this was in fact the same person, just on a different frequency.  Apparently, after calling us, she called a competitor who proceeded to tell her all sorts of fictitious information which she spewed upon me.

PG:  ""I spoke to your competitor and he told me a ton of lies (I don't remember what all she said but I think he got our name right.  Other than that, it was pretty much all false)""  
M:  <tries to debunk said lies>
PG:  ""He said you'd try to say that but I know better (I guess his lies were prettier than my truth?  No idea, I have a very pleasant phone voice, I guess his was just better)
M: ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but I'd be happy to go over everything and make sure you have a clear picture of what you're getting from both companies and clear up any misunderstandings if I can""  
PG: <Nothing vulgar was said but nothing complimentary at this point either.  I believe she did cast some aspersions upon my truthfulness and perhaps my parentage.  At this point, we were pretty much done>
M: ""If there's anything we can do for you, please let me know""
PG: <Click>

About 10 minutes later I get an email in my box from the harridan that I had been copied on.  I also realized that it was directed to my CEO who I was certain was going to read it.  It contained a litany of my sins, my shortfalls, my lack of ability to tell the truth, and quite possibly my severe lack of hygiene (none of which was true, especially the stinky part). I didn't realize how fast our CEO would read that but by the time I was through reading this sternly worded missive, my manager was popping out of his cubbyhole like he been shot from a gun.  He got an email, my director got one and both of them wanted to know what the hell I was doing.  Fortunately, I had a great rep on the floor and a couple of awards for being a customer advocate so I wasn't hoisted up on a stake to serve as an example for the rest of the staff.  It did, however, take a bit of telling the tale and swearing on an unopened copy of Microsoft Windows to convince them that I wasn't even half as horrible as I was portrayed in this work of fiction.

Now the revenge part.  Upon arriving to work that morning, I got a lovely piece of SPAM in my mailbox.  All I had to do to get all of the loveliest, filthiest, hardcore porn delivered to me daily was just give them my email address.  Since this was before the Canned SPAM act, there wasn't any of that pesky validation thing so with just a couple of clicks of a mouse, I made sure she was fully informed on every variation of every sexual position and fetish anyone could send her (for free even, what a bargain).  Not only had she emailed me from her corporate address, she even copied her home email so she could keep a copy of the dressing down she gave me presumably so she could cheer herself up by reading it when she couldn't find anybody in the office to have fired.  Not wanting her to miss out on her education into the ways of the world if she wasn't at work, I added that address too.  I'm not exactly what transpired at that point but knowing the wild west of porn spam at that time, I always rest assured that her email boxes were defiled and defiled and then defiled some more because once they had an address, even an act of God wouldn't get you off of it.

A note in regard to recent events,0,21qptp,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/,1056,1396181431.0,"Hello all,

I'd like to try clear up a few things.

**Rules**

We tend to moderate /r/technology in three ways, the considerations are usually:

1) Removal of spam. Blatent marketing, spam bots (e.g. http://i.imgur.com/V3DXFGU.png). There's a lot of this, far more than legitimate content.

2) Is it actually relating to technology? A lot of the links submitted here are more in the realms of business or US politics. For example, one company buying another company, or something relating to the American constitution without any actual scientific or product developments.

3) Has it already been posted many times before? When a hot topic is in the news for a long period of time (e.g. Bitcoin, Tesla motors (!), Edward Snowden), people tend to submit anything related to it, no matter if it's a repost or not even new information. In these cases, we will often be more harsh in moderating.

The recent incident with the Tesla motors posts fall a bit into 2) and a bit of 3).

I'd like to clarify that **Tesla motors is not a banned topic**. The current top post ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21q07g/model_s_now_comes_with_titanium_under_body_shield/)) is a fine bit of content for this subreddit. 

**Moderators**

There's a screenshot floating around of one of our moderators making a flippant joke about a user being part of Tesla's marketing department.

This was a poor judgement call, and we should be more aware that any reply from a moderator tends to be taken as policy. We will refrain from doing such things again.

A couple of people were banned in relation to this debacle, they've now been unbanned.

I am however disappointed that this person has been witch-hunted in this manner. It really turns us off from wanting to engage with the community. Ever wonder why we rarely speak in public - it's because things like this can happen at the drop of a hat. I don't really want to make this post.

It's a big subreddit, a rule-breaking post can jump to the top in a few short hours before we catch it.

Apologies for not replying to all the modmails and PMs immediately (there were a lot), hopefully we can use this thread for FAQs and group feedback.

Cheers.",controversial_subreddit,1,2014-03-30 07:10:31

I would understand if the game was a 2 hour long resident sleeper fest but it's not, the games are entertaining enough. Had to watch the entire game muted thanks to Slacks and did not stick around for game 2. Please no more Slacks cast.

play all 111 champions with 5 rune pages (do not upvote),1,1cajeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1cajeq/play_all_111_champions_with_5_rune_pages_do_not/,70,1365891209.0,"NOTE: if you don't like solomid guides you should probably stay away from this list :)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AmGVinPUDJhMdDRaYjk1YXB3a2VNOE1NNUNTemJ1bEE

This spreadsheet lists rune pages and builds for all of the 111 current champions - the trick is that you only need 5 rune pages!

Obviously there is a lot of compromise, so not every champion will be at his best with this approach - thats why there is a compatibility rating. In my opinion, every champion should be playable with these runes, but the yellow ones could be a bit.... shaky :D


Another compromise is not including every possible build (ad carry jayce, ap trist and similar things) - I just included what I think is played most - it's of course possible that I forgot to include something - let me know if there is a featured or approved build for it :).


Leave feedback for me in this post :) I will probably expand this to 6 pages, then 7 pages etc. until every champion has the ""perfect"" build, but I wanted to get the baseline out first :)

**In case it wasn't obvious:** This is of course most effective if you have all champions, or are at least close to it. If you only have access to around 30 champions there will probably be other rune pages that support those champions the best. For example, it's very possible you have zero AP Bruisers - in this case that page could be used to get other champions closer to the ideal build.

#/r/HillaryClinton 

**13,003** *voters* for **3 years!**

First, and introduction from the mod team.

>>/r/HillaryClinton is proud to be featured as today’s subreddit of the day. Our thanks go out to the mods here for allowing us to feature the most experienced and most qualified candidate in the presidential race. 

>>Hillary Clinton has always been a fighter.  After serving on the Watergate impeachment hearings, her first job in Arkansas was as a professor of criminal law at the University of Arkansas. A decade later, she was repeatedly listed as one of America’s 100 most powerful lawyers by The National Law Journal.  And she kept publishing influential journal articles.  In 1992, the New York Review of Books looked at her impact on the legal profession and declared: “She is one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades.”

>>Her experience as a United States Senator, First lady and Secretary of State will prove invaluable as we face some of the most contentious times of this century. While other candidates preach fear, gloom and calls for revolution, Clinton sees the progress we are making and vows to continue and expand on the success of the last administration. She is offering solutions. Not dismal prophecies of doom. If elected she will be able to hit the ground running like no other President in modern history. 

And now for the interview. 

>#**Hillary Clinton has lead of 333 pledged delegates. Given the proportional way that delegates are assigned in the Democratic nominating process, do you see any way where Sec. Clinton does not win the nomination?**


>>The pledged delegate lead is only expected to grow but even if it doesn’t, Clinton is too far ahead at this point to matter. Since delegates are awarded on a proportional basis, huge blowouts in all of the remaining primaries would be required to even come close. Being Hillary is favored in almost all of the remaining contests, this scenario is extremely unlikely. Clinton is just too far ahead. 

>>The Sanders campaign has also suggested flipping super delegates that now heavily favor Clinton. Earlier in the campaign he suggested these delegates in each state should go to whichever candidate won that state. Even if this were to occur, Hillary would still win. The fact is no matter how you look at it, Clinton will still win:

>>* Clinton wins with the super delegates

>>* Clinton wins without the super delegates

>>* Clinton wins with the popular vote

>>No matter how you look at it, there is no real path for Sanders to catch up.


>#Let's talk about super delegates. The Sanders people despise them and feel like they're stealing democracy. The GOP seems like they wish they had them. What is the role of the super delegate, and why do you think they're needed? Or maybe you don't think that. If not, just tells us your feelings on that.

>>Super delegates are state and federal representatives, senators, presidents and vice presidents, most of who are elected by the people to represent their state. They were created to allow party leaders to prevent selecting a completely unelectable nominee such as George McGovern, who lost to Nixon in 1972 by a landslide. Even so, super delegates have never over-ruled the will of the voters. **NEVER!!!** And they will not do so this time.

>>Still the Sanders campaign deemed them undemocratic. He was adamant they should go to the candidate with the most votes in their respective states. But now that this scenario no longer favors him, he feels the super delegates should support him anyway. Regardless, these are the rules set out from the beginning. You do not change the rules of a game at half-time. And even if you did, Clinton still wins no matter how you change the rules or calculate the delegates.



>#Who would Sec. Clinton rather run against in the general election, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, or someone else, and why?

>>We can't speak for the Secretary, but we’d imagine that she'd love to run against Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, both of whom she regularly trounces in head-to-head matchups. Honestly it really will not matter who wins the GOP nomination. But it sure would be fun to watch her take down Trump.


>#Are you worried that if Sec. Clinton wins the nomination that Bernie supports might not vote for her in November?

>>[Hillary addressed that](https://youtu.be/eqfGL_iTaBU?t=3m45s) herself in a GMA interview! In 2008, Clinton supporters said the same thing. The ""Bernie or Bust"" movement is very much an allegory for the Bernie Sanders campaign in general and is quite loud on the internet and social media. A lot will depend on Sanders himself but in the end, the possibility of a Trump presidency should be enough bring the party together along with independents.

>>Sanders supporters need to be aware that if a republican wins the White House in November, it would destroy all chances for any future Sanders to accomplish anything for decades to come. With a republican win, the Supreme Court would end up with a 6 – 3 conservative court for at least the next decade. Even if a future Sanders should win, anything he would accomplish would be overturned in the courts. The Supreme Court picks is one of the most crucial things the next president be responsible for.



>#Again, assuming a Clinton nomination, do you think that there's a role for Sen. Sanders in her administration? If so, what might that be?

>>This is one of those *what if* questions that is next to impossible to predict. Clinton has not given any clues as whether Sanders will be a part of her administration, though it is doubtful she would choose him as a running mate. There could be a cabinet position he would be considered for but at this point your guess is as good as ours. It would also depend on if Sanders rallies behind the Secretary after the primaries conclude.


>#Republican candidates have been suggesting that Sec. Clinton may be indicted over the now infamous email scandal. Can you care to comment on that?

>>Republicans and Sanders supporters’  have thrown every allegation they can against wall just praying something will stick. Just like Benghazi, they will claim she is guilty even though eight congressional hearings making for the longest congressional investigation history have turned up nothing. Republicans have publicly admitted it was all intentionally done to discredit the Secretary.

>>We already know that no information was classified at the time it was sent. The FBI investigation will be thorough and will find the Secretary did nothing illegal.  The DNC had a serious of long, serious discussions with Hillary Clinton and if they had any reservations there was even the slightest of chances she would be indicted, they would've stepped in months ago. Regardless, her opponents will claim differently regardless of what these investigation turn up. 

>>Secretary Clinton has taken everything republicans and Bernie Sanders supporters could throw at her and has still emerged as the Democrats' choice to represent them this fall and we are confident she will be America’s choice to lead them for the next four years.


>#Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has been repeatedly demanding that Sec. Clinton release transcripts of her private speeches to places like Goldman Sachs. So far she has not. Do you feel that her position on this is justified?

>>Believe it or not, this entire fuss is over three speeches in which most of the money received was donated to charity. She has repeatedly said when other candidates release similar information, she will release hers. Sanders said he has released his transcripts. This is an unfair comparison because he is not allowed by law to give paid speeches. Still Sanders has still failed to release his tax returns like he promised he would. He has released only one year. Clinton has released eight years of hers which shows she and Bill had a tax rate of 35% in spite of massive charitable donations. Sanders paid only 19% tax rate in spite of donating almost nothing to charity.

>>Hillary has provided far more personal information about herself than all the other candidates combined:

>>* https://www.hillaryclinton.com/tax-returns/


>>Until other candidates release their information, Clinton will not release hers. And be assured there will be much more to see in Donald Trump’s tax returns than you will ever find in three speeches given by Secretary Clinton. She is wise to hold on to this information in order to force Trump to release his information which up to now, he has been unwilling to do.

>#I think we can all agree that Hillary Clinton is not too popular on reddit. However, she seems to be popular enough to win most of the actual votes. To what do you attribute that disconnect?

>>Reddit has been a passionate voice for important issues around the globe. Often they are in the minority but that doesn’t discourage them in the least. Being that reddit demographics are largely made up of the under 29 population, it is no wonder they would get behind the candidate of change. Older folks have seen too many calls for revolution and are not so quick to jump on that train. But in any case, reddit has served as a catalyst to bring the youth of our country into the fold of politics and that is good for everyone. 



>>In conclusion we here at r/hillaryclinton want to say Bernie Sanders supporters have a lot to be proud of. No one would have believed you six months ago if you said he would come this far. And though it is tough to come this far and not win, do not be discouraged. Change can happen. It just takes a little longer than you think. 

>>Hillary Clinton has stood the test of time. She is a fighter. Republicans have tried every dirty trick in the book to discredit her and yet she still stands tall and is ready to fight for you. Please join us as we fight for her.

>>#Hillary 2016!

Have a good day!**

&nbsp;

This is pretty much the same story of EVERY new game. And it's ridiculous, it's hilarious how people feel entitled to say whatever they want behind a screen, how possible good criticism becomes bullshit because their arguments lack respect, I'm ashamed of being of the same species of some people these last days.

&nbsp;

I've been following this game's development for two years now, first heard of it on the E3 2014, I've saw every video, read pretty much every little bit of data about it, I've heard Sean speaking way too many times, in way too many interviews, to believe that all he's been saying so far has been lies. If you were a half decent person, you would go and watch any of those videos, and hear him speaking about developing the game of his dreams, the one he wanted to play since childhood.

Sean abandoned EA (and he had a way better job that he's been having these last years) and sold his house to develop games, Hello Games flooded, received death treats, was put under the pressure of being developing one of the most anticipated games for years, with a team of 12-15 people, working shifts of 15 hours, I don't know many developers who would do any of that, to be honest.

&nbsp;

And now, after launch, it's totally acceptable to complain if we can't see other players as it was promised, but what's the point at insulting these gals and guys? Will it make them hear you louder? All you've done these past days is burying under stupidity the wait of many users and the work of many developers.

At the end of the day, people will be people, and they'll respond violently to the most stupid problems, but mostly, this subreddit is full of worthy people, which can express their oppinions politely, and all I can do right now is thank you all for the awesome moments over these past years you've given me, you're all amazing.

&nbsp;

TL;DR: don't let stupidity get to you, express your complaints, but politely. My gratitude to all these people that has been polite during the years, you've given me a lot to remember.

&nbsp;

PS: 7 hours for the PC release!

&nbsp;

Edit: just because I see this comming: if you've paid 60 euros, it's your fault, I'm pretty sure that Sony put the price tag, not Hello Games, and it's been announced like that for a year and several months now, no point at complaining about a price tag, it doesn't make the game less indie, I'm happy to pay whatever I think a developer deserves, and this team has done more than enough to give them some money.

Edit 2: Sorry, I've lost that battle, I can't do absolutely anything about [this argument] (https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4xcsnk/as_if_programming_a_game_wasnt_difficult_enough/d6ejo80), sorry to all that expected me to keep trying to debate, I'm defeated.

>As a moderator of /r/Leagueoflegends, I can not thank the mods and users of /r/circlejerk enough for listening to /u/altosax29b's wise words. Your help will make sure this week will be quiet and lovely.

>Thanks to /u/GodOfAtheism for the lovely words aswell.

>Cheers

Now looking at those 2 comments further I definitely see that my sarcastic comment was misplaced. I also see why this stirred up so much drama.

I want to apologize for making this comment. It was misplaced, 

#Concering your valid points about this being brigading.

I'll try and talk about some of the valid points raised in the original thread. 

From /u/Paran014

>Regardless of how serious or not /r/circlejerk is, there sure was a lot of Paul Blart themed spam in the /new queue yesterday. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/search?q=paul+blart&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) are a couple examples. There were a lot more.

This is one of the things I did not see coming or thought about when I posted my comment. While writing that comment I did not mean anything I said. I thought I was safe from everything and anything because it's literally a sub for satire and being sarcastic. I never checked back on that comment after I posted it and didn't think much of it at all. 

I'm taking full responsibility for this mistake and will ofcourse reflect on it. I never intended this to happen but it still did which is something that should be taken seriously by me. If the community asks for my resignation as mod I will ofcourse comply.

>Are you seriously suggesting that if /r/circlejerk posted something like that while you were actively modding you'd post something funny about it while merrily deleting the endless stream of shit it prompts, or would you tell them that posting a sticky encouraging people to spam your subreddit is way over the fucking line?

I'm think that the user is trying to say that that if something like this would ever happen again if I would respond the same?

If that's the case, then no. Since that was my first time doing something like that I did not see the repricussions of posting the comment. I got caught up in the mod-free week and tried to have a little more fun then I should have. From now on I won't be posting in League related drama in either /r/circlejerk or /r/leagueoflegends. If I do decide to do it I will use a alt to make sure this doesn't ever happen again.

From /u/brodhi

>You know what the best option was? Not to open his fucking mouth. He is a moderator of a subreddit, and despite what you want he has responsibilities and an image to hold as one. Just because they are ""on break"" doesn't mean he can go willy-nilly shitposting and ""sarcastically"" encouraging brigading on a subreddit whose entire purpose is to vote brigade. The amount of kissass that goes on from some users is insane. They could bring back Hitler himself and you would say, ""LEAVE THE MODS ALONE!!!!""

This is pretty much the only correct thing I should've done. I never should've commented on a /r/leagueoflegends related drama thread and it was fucking stupid to do so. I did not carefully consider how this could influence the subreddit itself or if it was at all professional to post the comment.

From /u/smiletodie

>Richard Lewis got banned because he linked reddit comments in his Twitter.
You clearly asked for brigading this subreddit as a mod. You have a lot of followers and even if you were joking this sub got spammed with Paul Blart.

Looking at it now I feel like it can be compared to the brigading drama with Voldemort. Although I did not ask for it directly or officially speaking as a moderator it still led to brigading which is why I should face these concerns and apologize for them. 

From /u/sorenthaz

>Mods are honestly showing their true colors/motives behind the mod-free week at this point. They take it as a joke and an excuse to manipulate matters to favor their objectives (in this case, proving that we need their strict moderation).

This is not the case. This was a individual mistake and I never had any agenda behind it and I honestly think it doesn't look like that either. I never actually considered this would influence the subreddit in such a way. Honestly speaking, I do from time to time think that less-strict moderation could be a good thing for this subreddit.

#My response in the front-page thread

After I heard about the post getting upvoted I quickly tried to explain that none of it was serious

Here's what I said:

>This was posted in /r/circlejerk, a totally non-serious subreddit. Anything I say there should not be taken seriously

>Edit; Also we're not removing anything unless a post violates our mod-free week rules. ~~You can go ham on me all you want but if this is something I'm ging to be witch-hunted for you need to set tour priorities straight~~

>Did not word that as I wanted to, I'll reply to everyone's concerns when I'm home.

I want to specifically talka bout the crossed out part. I was way too agressive there as I did not realize what exactly I did wrong. I hadn't found out about the brigade actually being a fact and did not see it was much of a big deal yet. Ofcourse looking at it now that reply was pretty much the worst thing I could say.

In the replies following my comment I learned about how the brigading actually happend and how much I did actually fuck up so I immediatly retracted my statement. I'm sorry for commenting with pretty much the worst thing I could say.. :)





#Final statement.

I hope this shines some more light on the situation. I never intended it to create such a mess and will reflect on it personally. As I've said before, if the community feels that I should not be representing the moderation team anymore please tell me honestly. 

Also I wanted to say a quick thank you to the users who send me supportive messages. Thanks so much.

^^^big Sorry for everything, thank you for reading.

/r/movies is back! A note on what happened yesterday.,0,3c0xn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3c0xn6/rmovies_is_back_a_note_on_what_happened_yesterday/,382,1435951696.0,"Yesterday, the mods of /r/movies voted unanimously to join /r/IAmA and /r/science in going private in protest to the actions of the Reddit admins.   Today we voted unanimously to end our protest and bring the subreddit back.  We thank you for your patience and understanding.

Much has been said by many people about the coordinated black-out across Reddit.  Our participation was directly related to Victoria's key position at Reddit, not just coordinating of AMAs but also as the only admin that responded regularly to our concerns and needs as moderators.

Our sole goal with this subreddit is to provide a forum for the discussion of movies and the motion picture industry.  Unfortunately we cannot do that without a supportive infrastructure in place.  Victoria's dismissal was effectively a dismissal of that infrastructure.  As such, we recognized the need to draw attention to the issue.  

We do not consider the issues caused by Victoria's departure to be resolved, but we also do not consider a repeated blackout of /r/movies to be useful in resolving them.  We are working with the Admins and the moderators of other subreddits to bridge the gap; in the interim, we are returning the subreddit to normal.

For those of us who joined us in /r/flicks yesterday, thanks for checking out the sub.  We encourage you to say subscribed, as we view /r/flicks as a safe ""back room"" further from the default mentality.  And for everyone: thanks for your patience and understanding.  If we didn't think this was necessary to ensure the quality of the sub moving forward, we wouldn't have done it.

So, I've been playing this game since 2010, I was Diamond 3, I've spent at least $1000 in skins, dedicated hundreds of hours to the game - basically I cared a lot about League, and still do, which is why I am now turning to the community to help me out. 

Here's what happened: On July 9th, after not having played the game for weeks I try to log in and it tells me my account has been permanently suspended. It was banned because they believe I was found to be using some sort of third party program to gain an unfair advantage in my games. http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/20687433#profile If you look at my match history, there's no way I'm getting some unfair advantage seeing as I have about a 55% win ratio and my match history is certainly not all wins.

I live in a shared housing unit with about 5 other people. We all commute to college and happen to all play League. The only thing I can think of is that they banned all the accounts from this IP address without realizing that it's actually a lot of different people that play here. I've sent two tickets to Riot explaining my circumstance and this is the response I've gotten from Riot support.
I've taken a look at your account, and you were found to be tampering with the game in such a manner that it was giving you an unfair competitive advantage over other players. This has resulted in a permanent suspension of your account that I will not be able to reverse.

Please note this section from the Terms of Use to which you agreed:

""H. Participating in any action which, in the sole and exclusive judgment of Riot Games, ""exploits"" an undocumented aspect of the Game in order to secure an unfair advantage over other users""

This was clearly a copy and pasted response, and it was obvious to me he put forth zero effort in actually INVESTIGATING this situation. On July 19th I submitted another ticket pleading with Riot to investigate the matter further so that they could see it wasn't me who did this third party stuff but rather someone else that lived with me. When I submitted this ticket I managed to get the exact same person and he gave me this rude reply: Hi kKazuo,

I see your concern has been handled over in ticket #12622030; if you've no new concerns at this time, I'll be considering this matter closed as well.

Best regards,

I'm begging for the help of my fellow LoL players. This Riot support member is certainly not interested in actually doing his job and would rather just close tickets and move on as to not legitimately deal with a problem that might be a bit of a headache. Please help my post gain some visibility so I may have a better chance at a real investigation. 

If my account's suspension for whatever reason is not removed I at least want to see this Rioter that handled my ticket receive some disciplinary action for his unprofessional behavior

(Crow Business) After the Storm,0,32m7lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/32m7lc/crow_business_after_the_storm/,841,1429050306.0,"Fellow Crows,

It certainly has been an *interesting* weekend, thats for sure.

As most of you know by now, the media pre-release of the first four episodes were leaked on Saturday night/Sunday morning.     

In keeping with our policy on piracy, which dates back to the earliest days of this subreddit, we as a moderation team decided that it was only fair to restrict discussion of episodes to those which have aired legitimately on HBO and its partner networks worldwide. As with any major decision, this has been met with both support and ire from many members of the community.

This decision was taken out of respect for those who have worked tirelessly for years to produce this show, and out of respect for the rights of those content creators to disseminate their work as they see fit. 
To allow these leaks on this sub, even in a restricted form, is a slap in the face to the people who create the content we all enjoy so much. 

This decision allows safe passage into all threads for our subscribers who do not want to pirate the episodes. They should not be disadvantaged by that decision. With the early release of TWOIAF in some Target stores, we took the stand that no discussion should be allowed on the sub until the book was officially released, a widely popular decision. This is the same position we are taking here. These episodes are **not** available legally, and until they are, we are not allowing discussion of their details here. 

We also want to emphasize the distinction between the screeners & early screenings and the leaks. Those screeners were meant for media outlets to prepare previews for their audiences, previews which did not reveal every plot detail.  They were distributed by HBO in good faith, and that trust has been broken. As it stands we cannot discern between someone who has legitimately seen Eps 2-4, and someone who has illegally obtained them, whereas before this leak, that was not an issue. 

Was our reaction ideal? No. We had no way to anticipate either the leak itself or the [massive influx of traffic on the sub](http://imgur.com/qYop0qm) which this leak would create (on top of the expected influx of traffic as the premiere aired). Simply put, we were caught off guard. 

We are real people, we have jobs, this is something we do in our spare time. This leak has been the largest amount of modding work many of us have ever had to do, but we do it because it is something we fundamentally believe in. 

Finally, to address some of the main points of contention. 

* **Did some people get banned unfairly?** Yes, we are fully prepared to admit this. Many of these bans have been rescinded since the furore has quietened down. Anyone who has been banned is fully entitled to seek clarification from us. 

* **But what about set leaks, interviews etc? Why were those allowed before?** There's no consensus as of yet about what the threshold for a leak should be. Is it a set photo? Is it an alleged portion of a script? Is it an extra's recounting of a scene? We've allowed these in the past and it's been used as justification for allowing the leak spoilers.
Our stance is, and always has been, that the pirated leak of the four episodes is fundamentally different to photos or recollections. We don't view them in the same category and we don't think allowing one means we're required to allow the other. 


Going forward, a new episode becomes available every week, and the size of the leak diminishes, until thankfully by May 4th, we can put this incident behind us, and move forward together as a community once again. 

We don't ask you to agree with us, we simply ask you to respect our decision. 

Yours Kindly,

The /r/asoiaf mod team.

Lee Sin Lessons,156,20qrd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/20qrd9/lee_sin_lessons/,1818,1395171175.0,"Hey everyone,
 
I read through all your replies / feedback on our Lee Sin retune, and I have made some changes! But before I get to them, I think there’s some misunderstanding to why we’re making the changes to Lee Sin and how these changes will impact him. Some of you read my posts and responded (good feedback!), but a lot just saw lower numbers and got angry (not good!). So a few things:

-

•         ***From our changes, it felt like Lee Sin’s ‘identity’ was under attack (assassin early > utility tank late / strong early > weak late)***



Changing Lee Sin’s identity was never our intention! If it seemed like that, then your feedback is good in checking us.
 
From our own understanding (and your feedback), we see Lee Sin as a risky, high-skill champion who makes really cool plays in the early game and gets rewarded for that playstyle (especially in the early game where small-scale skirmishes take place). The problem was that he had very low risk because of his raw strength in stats and abilities that even if he made a misplay, he could always recover. We are absolutely fine with early game Lee being strong and late game Lee being weaker than most, but we wanted to create real risk for Lee in the early game and, if he succeeds, give him a path forward to play in the late game. This is more true (but not absolutely driven by) competitive play, which is more focused on early power champions. Speaking of competitive, early game Lee Sin (for teams that can play him) is so strong that he often crowds out any alternative choice (because there’s very little he can’t do for the demands of competitive junglers). 
 
Late game Lee Sin is the opposite - the most frustrating part was that he lost a lot of relevancy late game no matter how well he did early game (this is important!). Late game Lee has no prolonged threat to give him a presence except his initiation (which can be very unreliable), so he has to pull off an extremely mechanically difficult play to be considered “successful,” and then he’s almost completed his job. If Lee **can’t** pull off that kind of play, he gets punished for “misplaying.” Even if Lee makes a lot of successful ganks and goes into the late game with a lot of kills, he often loses because he has no strong way to take advantage of it (unless he’s really, really far ahead). We wanted to give Lee Sin some options while staying true to his perceived power curve of being strong early and weaker late.

A summary here would be that we like champions who are strong early or are strong late, but at least part of those strengths should come from player skill and not all the champion being picked. I know Lee Sin 'feels' very balanced because all of his abilities are skill shots, but he keeps a lot of his power even when he fails, which isn't true of a lot of champions.

•         ***Nobody appreciates the attack speed buffs on Flurry.***


I made a mistake in communicating this the first time, so I’ll say this: this isn’t a buff to how Lee Sin is played **right now**, but it’s a buff to how he **can** be played when he has a real late game presence. I wish I could show you how much smoother Lee Sin feels to play with these changes because it lets him get his energy back from Flurry so he can use more spells. He's also a lot 'stickier' in following opponents because he can get a few attacks out in between his abilities (and much faster). 

In late game team fights Lee Sin is very weak so he could only use his spells for damage. The attack speed buff to Flurry means he can finally deal sustained damage at all points in the game so he’s not trapped in only finding the ideal initiation window (insec play).

•	***Ward Hopping was too punishing.***


Once again, we like the play pattern and think it's cool, but it was giving Lee tons of frustrating mobility without real offensive / defensive tradeoffs. We're very firm on that belief! But from your feedback, it was clear that energy cost increases on Safeguard would make Lee no longer able to perform his best combo, so we've reverted it. We still need to make some kind of tradeoff here, so he'll be giving up the safety of the self-shield if he jumps to minions / wards. 

We also think it's important to reduce a little bit of Lee's frustrating mobility moments so we're also sticking with the increased base cooldown that gets reduced when you cast it on an allied champion. This also rewards / incentivizes Lee to cooperate with his team instead of being a self-sufficient monk.

-

•	***The change to Dragon's Range was too different from what Lee currently has.***


Agree. With so many changes in this retune it could be easy to see this change as just a damage nerf. In the early to mid game, Dragon's Rage is mostly used as a high damage execute and in the late game, Dragon's Rage is mostly used as a positioning / 'insec' play to isolate a target. We made this change to add more consistency in the choice while also reducing some of Dragon's Rage's really high early game power. So you would choose to either isolate a target from his/her team, or you would choose to kick someone **into** the enemy team for massive damage. This would be a choice you could always take throughout the game rather than one you're forced you take because your power fell off.

Still, it's a lot of change so we're going to keep it like it is on live (but we'll still need to reduce the damage on it because it deals really high base damage, especially when Lee is ahead). I still think it's important that there be a tradeoff between isolating a target or dealing maximum damage, but we'll think of that in the future.

Now that I've written so much... you can have the changes! I really hope you take the time to read through the above so you can understand the changes below. I also noticed some misunderstanding behind total attack damage versus bonus attack damage.  While it does seem like some values are much lower than their current live values, the scaling with total attack damage means Lee Sin will scale better into late game but will snowball less when he gets a bunch of AD items in the early game.

Okay they don't stream so you don't get to see their personalities as MUCH as you might see NA players' personality. However that doesn't mean their robots walking around, just playing games. I'd be pretty pissed as a player if I came out of a world's game against another region and all the comments are rather about ""personality"" rather than skill difference. Then again that's probably why I'm not a pro (among many many other reasons). 

EU actually has a lot of personalities and the players have amazing banter, especially via Twitter. I don't have a twitter account but even I browse through their from time to time cause EU players are quite often stirring shit up.

When they're on the analyst desk as well, or casting on the double bot lane stream (Krepo, Zven and Mithy put up an amazing cast) you CAN see their personalities quite clearly. 

I'm of course an EU fan so I'm naturally biased but I'm also a fan of League E-Sports in general. I am not saying NA, KR or EU are equal in terms of ""personality"". All I'm trying to say is this idea of ""EU players have no personality"", is a SUBJECTIVE opinion but an opinion that shows a lack of knowledge of the scene and it's players.

And for the love of God please don't turn the comment section into  EU > NA or NA > EU.

If you going to stop playing because some caster wasnt hired well maybe you give  to much importance to this game in your life, Joe and Deman leave and the game is still alive some ppl now maybe dont know who they were and what they did for LoL so if monte decide to leave and that means no more drama and one arrogant ego less im happy , i dont care how good he was, people come and people leave all the time and life dont ends.

"Sexual harassment is not okay. I'm here to play the raid, not listen to you making crude jokes.",28,3rafjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3rafjq/sexual_harassment_is_not_okay_im_here_to_play_the/,756,1446512726.0,"First off, let me say, I made a post a few weeks ago about how much I love the Destiny community because, as a girl, I have had little bad experiences. I had a few people add me off of Reddit and I have played with them more than once. They have all been wonderful. This is the first bad experience I have had in Destiny and I want to share this so that maybe I can help prevent anything of the sort from happening to my fellow female guardians.
My boyfriend and I ALWAYS play together. If I'm on and I'm in a fireteam, you can bet that my boyfriend will be there. So with that being said, my boyfriend and I were running strikes and we got invited by a random who had added me from patroling the Dreadnaught to do the raid. We thought sure, why not. So we joined and while the random who invited us didn't say too much, there were two guys in the group who would not stop making derogatory and crude statements towards me. I was the only girl in the lobby. You see, I can deal with immaturity, I can deal with blatantly gross sex statements and jokes. No big deal. What I can't deal with is you undermining me and acting like I can't play the game because I'm a girl or you making disgusting sex jokes and statements about me. That. Is. NOT. Okay. Now remember, my boyfriend was in the party and fireteam the whole time, he heard everything that was said to me. Such as when we were waiting for the kid to get to the chest by the pistons I was messing around and killing my teammates by pushing people off the ledge, this guy said ""I'm going to pull your pants down and spank you, nasty girl."" NOT OKAY. I let that slide because I really wanted to finish the raid. But as we continued on, the insults, statements, and ""jokes"" got worse and worse. My boyfriend was getting seriously pissed and I was extremely uncomfortable. We get to the sisters and my boyfriend sends me a text asking to leave because he was too mad and was afraid he would seriously insult this kid if he kept being crude to me. So we left.

Oh and let me say, I'm 306 light, I have the exotic sword, the NTTE, the Black Spindle, the ToM, and I have beaten the raid multiple times. I can hold my own just as well as a guy can. When I'm playing Destiny my gender does not define me. We are all guardians, regardless of gender.

Moral of the story, do not under any circumstances think that sexual harassment is okay. Those ""jokes"" that you might think are funny are very offensive and crude. And let me just remind you, women get sexually abused and raped every day. You never know what trauma they have faced and you never know if your words may trigger them. We female guardians came here to play the raid, just like you, and we do not want to listen to you being a chauvinist pig just because we are girls.

This is the first bad experience I have had and hopefully my last. I genuinely believe that as whole the Destiny community is better than this. We're a great community, let's keep it this way. This is simply a friendly reminder to watch what you say, just because you think it is funny does not make it okay. 

Keep fighting guardians, women and men alike! We're ALL guardians. 

Edit: Let me add, my boyfriend and I did tell them to stop. Multiple times. But they continued to do so and that's the reason we left when we got to the sisters.

Edit 2: While I'll agree that we should have left earlier, it was late at night and we just wanted to finish the raid without having to get a whole other group together. That's why we didn't leave earlier. Also, this didn't start until about halfway through the raid (Golgoroth). Oh and when I say the sisters I'm referring to Oryx's daughters, that's what we call them. 

Edit 3: As you can all see I received a fair amount of hate for this post which was honestly well expected. Let me make it clear that not once did I say that men aren't treated unfairly as well. As a matter of fact, during this same raid experience, the guys wouldn't stop yelling at my boyfriend and blaming him for stuff that they messed up on. They treated him awful as well. Yes I did make this post gender specific, I did that for a reason and if you can't see the reasoning behind it then I won't even bother explaining it to you. I am well aware that men get mistreated in the gaming community but the fact of the matter is that is often much more frequent and much worse when women are playing. 

With all that being said, I have actually had quite a few really nice people add me from this post. Some that added me last night actually helped us beat the sisters and Oryx before the reset. So despite all of the hate I've received, some good did come from this post. To all the positive comments and messages, and to the people who added me THANK YOU SO MUCH. You all are what keeps inspiring me to continue with gaming. To my female guardians, keep your chin up and keep fighting. To all my male guardians (the ones that aren't complete assholes), thank you for making women gamers feel more welcome in the gaming community.",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-11-02 19:05:26

Why? Every day imagine this feeling.

You arrive at school and head to the breakfast line to get some food. You are so nervous about the day already starting out terrible due to the Bully and his posse. But you're lucky today - no outbursts.

You get your food, and sit down with your best buddies. You start to take the first bite of your food, and before it even entering your mouth it's smacked out of your hands, and you're called a queer, faggot, retard, loser, waste. Every day it was different.

There was pain in gym class which i had to retake my senior year due to FEAR in my freshmen year of taking it.

I even was in this program called ""Shop"". It's where kids went to another facility on a bus to learn a trade. I had to use the same bus as him due to our last names being close. Alphabetical order (Even if i tried sneaking on the other bus i'd just get in trouble)

When the kid would get on, or off the bus i'd get physically slapped, punched or pushed along with tons of name calling that was just hurtful. I remember specifially these things they would make with soda bottles where they would let all the air out, twitch it up to an extreme amount, seal the bottle and launch the cap off VERY hard hitting me in the back of the head.

Now recap that from your 6th grade year up until your senior year, and yes I tried talking to councilers who had it written down that I'd receive some sort of help - but it seemed like nothing helped. I had told the crooked principle, dean and numerous teachers, and with the exception of a FEW teachers it just seemed like me saying anything just got myself into more trouble with them.

With what? A friends pocket knife

Did he live? Yes I stabbed him in the lower part of his neck, his shoulder, and his side.

My consequences? I was under house arrest a month, probation 6 months, 6 years of hell on earth and not being able to even attend my graduation.

Did he bully me again? Nope - never saw him again after that day.

It happened like this..

During 7th period (Our final period) he kept throwing paper at me and cutting his throat with his finger. I kept looking away from him and holding onto that knife in my pocket... We get up to leave, and I'm thinking to my self ""This shit is crazy, i'd never actually do something like that, haha""

Then all of a sudden he turns around, talks some shit and before I even have the chance to say anything he kicks me VERY hard in the nuts, and punches me so hard that my tooth actually goes through my lip. At that time I'm pushed backwards on my best friend into a door, he pushes me up and says ""Get him!""

I black out there, but after I come to I'm standing there with blood on the floor, lockers and knife screaming ""You will never bully anyone else again, you're done"" and I just kept saying ""You're threw with this shit!"" ""You're Done!"" over, and over.

There were 50 or so kids circled around us in the hallway after it was done.





The most horrible experience of all was missing out on 99% of social activities during my middle, and high school time. I didn't even get to walk the stage during graduation, or even ATTEND it for that matter. I was the bad guy.


edit 1 I Just want to say **thank you** to everyone giving me their support, and kind words. It truly means a lot to me. I hope anyone else going through the same things I went through can get SOME SORT of help. Better help then I received at least.






edit 2 WOW this blew up WAY bigger then I thought it would have! I am taking a small break (11:48AM EST) Right now, I'll answer some more questions in a little bit. 

edit 3 I'm back shortly - I'm answering as many questions as I can! 

edit 4 Okay I have things to take care of - I have to call it quits for today. If this is still up tomorrow i'd be happy to answer more questions, and feel free to privately message me if you're being bullied, and just need someone to talk to. Have a nice day.

Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.

Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.

Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.

Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.

I believe these policies strike the right balance.

update: I know some of you are upset because we banned *anything* today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit.

This is faulty logic because suicide is a much greater danger in our society and Dota 2's demographic than racism, sexism, and homophobia.  


>In 2013, 41,149 suicides were reported, making suicide the 10th leading cause of death for Americans


>Suicide is the SECOND leading cause of death for ages 10-24


>Suicide is the THIRD leading cause of death for college-age youth and ages 12-18


>More teenagers and young adults die from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease, COMBINED


>It is very common to play with someone suffering from depression and it is not okay to contribute to his mental illness or belittle mental health's significance.


Also, it is not okay for Sumail to say ""kill yourself"" because it is common in Pakistani culture.  Sumail isn't living in Pakistan, but in the United States of America.  If Sumail made racist, homophobic, or sexist remarks and tried to rationalize it by saying it was common in his culture, would you tolerate it?  Then why is it okay for him to get away with suicidal insults?

I got access to one of the biggest cheats in CS:GO for public use (paid one),220,3u7kg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3u7kg6/i_got_access_to_one_of_the_biggest_cheats_in_csgo/,750,1448455397.0,"Hey,
This is not a thread where I will be saying that I cheat and got banned. I never cheat even tho I have access to a paid cheat that has been undetected since the launch of CS:GO, it's also safe for FaceIT, ESEA and CEVO.

I got access to the injector and the cheat launcher, can I provide that to valve somehow and make them use it against the cheat providers or is just the cheat it self useless for them to have?

Why do I have access to a cheat but I am not cheating you may ask, this is because I helped an admin on the page with some issues he had (not cheat related) and there for got 1 month of free subscription.
I have tested and verified that the cheat works, I did so by using -insecure and load the cheats vs bots.

Just want to help the community out if possible in the battle vs cheaters. Any ideas if I can be helpful by using any of the things I have access to?

EDIT:
I do not have permissions to post in the VAC forum of valve. That is why I have not reported this cheat via their forum. So if any other way is possible I would like to know.

I can still sign in, launch the cheat and use it (have still not been used other then private server). As stated before it's HWID banned to my computer but I can unlock that ban before I send it to anyone of interest.

And no, I don't know that much about programming etc, the issue I helped them with has nothing to do with webpage/programming.

EDIT 2:
Tried to get as many of the files as possible while running the cheat and save them down (creates new ones each time you use it), also made a video of how the cheat installs/works, what it does to you computer when injected and also what ""drivers"" you need to install in order to run it. Hopefully all this will be to some sort of help for someone. I will just sit tight on it until I can post on the VAC forums or get in contact with someone important.

My guess is that a ban is incoming shortly on my account for the cheat. So I want to gather as much info as possible before getting myself banned. Valve wont answer me and I can't sit around for days just waiting for them so this was my try of doing something for the community. Hopefully it all works out.

No more updates will be posted since this lead to nothing except a lot of trash talking. 
Sorry that I upset so many people and there is lies being called all over the place. I tried.

I paid monies, gimme NAO!!!"". 

Needless to say, this small but excessively vocal group evokes the same feelings in me as a little shitter starting to cry aboard the airplane in the middle of a transatlantic flight might evoke in anyone.

I'm a software developer. I absolutely dearly remember my BEST contract job ever when, effectively, I was told, ""Here's your workstation. Here's the spec of what we need. Go for it."" There was no time limit, no pressure, no nothing: the guy who contracted me *knew* that software is ready when it's ready, and not any sooner. The result was the *best* product I ever produced.

This is exactly the reason why I donated nearly $29000 (yes that's *twenty-nine thousand*) to RSI: I *know* that Chris is aiming for the best quality a dev can dream of, and not for some shitty ""get-it-out-of-the-door-now"" crap: no, it will be ready *when it's ready*, and I will not accept anything less.

Now, that said, I despise the abovementioned crybabies not only because they piss off me personally, but also because they are stealing CIG's valuable time (paid for, in a not too insignificant part, by myself).

So, I propose a ""Shut up and take [back] your money"" detox program. Namely: the community will identify the most annoying ""Why X is not out yet"" complainer out there, and I will contact Customer Support to figure out how much (or rather, how little) that crybaby has donated to the game. THEN, I will *buy him out*: I will pay him back everything he put in (except for physical goods and subscriptions of course, because he already got back his value on those) on the condition that he will be *banned forever* from the game and the forums. 

What do you think?

Riot's bias against CLG is nonexistent,147,48dano,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/48dano/riots_bias_against_clg_is_nonexistent/,307,1456789184.0,"I really don't understand how the other thread got 1500+ up votes. Why/how would Riot benefit from being biased against CLG. Riot is not a person we aren't even talking about Riot we're talking about the production team who puts together teasers/videos for the LCS so I don't see how bias would affect what content they put together. Their end goal is just to make the most hype teasers they can and pursue the best story lines possible. The examples of ""Riot's bias"" given in the previous thread were so poor.

1. **Lunch with DL and Yellowstar:** Riot showing a video about TSM's new bot lane as the intro to the new season instead of something about CLG. Serious? Doublelift to TSM was the biggest roster move to happen in NALCS of all time. Yellowstar leaving FNC rivals it. The two players on the same roster is ridiculously hype. Focusing on that story line over talking about CLG (who were coming into the split with a different roster and not even the same team who won the previous split) is not an indication of bias.

2. **CLG vs C9 game:** Yes, the teaser for this game should have included more footage about CLG. With that said, trying to argue that CLG has some kind of story line going that even come close to rivaling what Riot can talk about C9 is insane.

3. **Cutting Aphro's Interview Off:** Unlike what OP claimed, we have seen interviews with the losing team before, and we have seen interviews with both losing and winning teams before. They are rare but that's common sense. Losing teams aren't usually up for interviews. Seeing both perspectives of the game is awesome I don't know why you'd be against it. Maybe they shouldn't have cut off Aphro's time or they could have made the transition smoother but that's on the production team. Claiming that this is a result of ""bias"" though is once again far-fetched at best.

Overall, we will most likely see CLG hyped up more and be more relevant in story lines. Stixxay's improvements and Darshan's split pushing are great places to talk about but just because other teams have greater story lines to talk about does not mean that Riot's production team has some kind of weird unprecedented bias against a team.

Edit: Some good discussion and counter points! I still tend to believe that at the worst Riot slightly favors other teams and their story lines but I don't think you classify that as ""bias"". Also, Please ignore my flair. I am not a IMT fanboy salty about CLG winning. I don't really openly support any team and just like watching good games. I tend to flair whichever team has players that I like on it. I love POB, WT, and Huni. I love Darshan and Aphro just as much.",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-02-29 17:39:44

So, I watched a lot of TI4 last year and even more TI5 this year, and I had a ton of fun watching it - but as an otherwise-exclusive LoL player (maybe like 5 Dota 2 bots games played), I enjoyed watching it a ton, and the hype and storylines, but I didn't really understand what was going on in each game that well.

So, last year, for LoL Worlds I wrote a guide for newbies to League of Legends who wanted to watch Worlds anyway, and now it's updated for 2015!

Sections:

* [Intro](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/New_To_League/Introduction)
* [A bit about the metagame](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/New_To_League/Meta)
* [Labeled minimap screenshots with areas highlighted](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/New_To_League/Map_Features)
* [Stream overlay explanation](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/New_To_League/Understanding_the_Stream) (this will be updated with the new UI once it's live, but currently we don't have any footage of live events with the new spec UI)
* [Items explanations](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/New_To_League/Important_Items)
* [Champion Flashcards](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/New_To_League/Champion_Flashcards/Alphabetically) - this is probably the most useful thing, it's a flashcard for each champ that explains in a really TLDR way what they do, but also has a link to their full infopage

Monte has called OG vs FW BO5 ""*scientific experiment designed to produce the most boring LoL bo5*"". 
Todays games between 2 Korean teams have been ever worse. Slower pace with more/same amount of mistakes than OG-FW game. 

Please don't get me wrong, Korea is strongest region undoubtedly, but are they really Gods many have claimed, or are there mere ""mortals""?

CIG will go through your PMs if you criticise them,21,47fl39,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/47fl39/cig_will_go_through_your_pms_if_you_criticise_them/,852,1456353785.0,"Maybe a bunch of people will think I'm an asshole who deserves this, but I thought you guys should know something that I discovered today when I got banned from the CIG forums.  My story is as follows:

I've never posted on the CIG forums before, but on the 12th of Dec I read a heart breaking thread by a guy who had fallen on hard times and felt the game hadn't delivered.  He was refused a refund and was really down in the dumps about it.  I didn't want to cause drama but I sent him a PM telling him that EU consumer law and bank charge back policies may mean that he may be able to get his money back.  Maybe you hate me for suggesting this to him, but I honestly felt sorry for him.

2 and a half months go past and all is well.  I've still not made any posts on the forums, until yesterday when I made a few posts criticising CIG's marketing and one post about Sandi being thoughtless on the livestream with regard to Ben and some doughnuts.

A few hours later I am banned, the reason reads:

> Perma'd per report that user sent PM's encouraging backers to commit bank fraud.  Investigation confirms.

Now whether or not sending a PM about EU consumer law and bank refunds is ""bank fraud"" is an interesting question, but my first thought was ""what the hell, I sent that PM months ago and he only just reported me?""

So I check the guy's account.  He's not logged in since Jan 6th.  So I send the guy an email apologising if I have offended him and asking if he reported my PM.  He says he didn't report it and he's shocked that I am banned.  He says he received 10+ similar PMs and is worried that all of those people are now also banned.

Now, say what you will about whether or not what I said was ban worthy.  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

One thing is clear though.  If you criticise CIG on the forums forums in a way that is totally within the rules, they will go through your PMs to find any excuse to ban you.  No doubt about it.

Hopefully this information will help others avoid getting banned as I have been.  Apparently CIG will try to ban critics in any way they can.

Riot is Insisting that Teams Cover the Ticket Price Difference to Fly to Worlds from Korea,7,3l7brj,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3l7brj/riot_is_insisting_that_teams_cover_the_ticket/,496,1442428540.0,"A report recently released through the DailyDot states that Riot is refusing to pay for the tickets to fly teams currently bootcamping in Korean to Europe for worlds. Riot and the teams had stipulated that the plane tickets to worlds would be covered *but only from their place of residence*. The teams bootcamping in Korea right now would prefer that Riot fly them out directly as has been custom. Riot is insisting that Teams pay their way or at least pay the difference between the two ticket prices. E.g. CLG would have to pay the difference between an NA-EU ticket and KO-EU ticket, while Riot would cover the amount originally stipulated to.

I'm posting here for discussion of the topic, head over to DailyDot to see the original article.

**EDIT**: ~~The article isn't 404'd. The URL on the DailyDot that links to the article is incorrectly entered. It's missing ""-lol"". Hopefully they fix it because I cannot link the direct URL here.~~ The URL has been fixed. You can access it by visiting the DailyDot's ""Esports"" topic page. I cannot directly link it here.

~~**EDIT 2**: I'm in class but I'll explain a bit about what the ""issue"" is here since a lot of people seem to see it as a non-issue.~~

**EDIT 3**: Moved my explanation to a comment because people were finding it too biased. I added it because I received a large number of comments dismissing the issue as a non-issue. That opinion is fair and I don't blame anyone for having it. But I saw that happening because of the article's issue with its URL improperly linking on DailyDot's website. To explain why people *should* be paying attention, I explained how I saw the problems here. If that came off as too biased against Riot (putting my biases out there, I do think Riot should cover the costs), **I apologize**. The article now properly links, so you can just head over there to see it.

Ok, but hear my points and try to think before",5,4o1qbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/4o1qbj/im_10_years_in_it_i_witnessed_how_mobile_market/,212,1465915639.0,"I run an IT company, I know how things in market are from business terms. VR is an emerging market, very fragile, and it could die in its infancy, even before it takes off

Game dev is not a charity, game devs need $ to break even at least, or better if you want a next bigger game from them. If you want to have great VR content it needs A LOT of investment. From business angels, private investors, funds and so on. If some of investors are successful others would come, if some of a bigger investors are unsuccessful it's toxic for all the market

Steam is a harsh PC games monopoly and in order to compete with them you need some leverages. For example, a closed platform ecosystem(remember, how Steam all started in 2003? It was all the same). Even with this practice it's really hard to complete with monopoly, only Riot or Blizzard come near to it(in a much smaller scope, though) 

It's hardware pushing up software sales and vice versa. Call it Apple way, game consoles way, or just something way -- but this practice is there for decades and there's nothing anti-consumer in it

Vive sales are already slowing down a bit from June 1st and there're no more than 65-70k of Vive owners to date. (Go to SteamSpy for the sources)

Let it be 100k of Vives to August 1st(still optimistic, but ok). Best selling Vive game(only one from MANY MANY others) could sell up to 50% of user base. Let it be a $20 game, because why not? And good guys Valve would take 30%+ of commision(it could be 40%, but let's assume 30%)

It means than THE BEST SELLING Vive game could give it's devs as much as $700k, not counting cost of making. Maybe more, maybe less, but the possible ROI(return of investment) ballpark is tiny, the market is still so small

It's just nothing in terms of sales or game investment; ZERO market. If not for Oculus and their exclusives we'd stay with crappy Steam Early Access indie and paid demos for YEARS. VR needs to go to mass market and it means HIGH quality content for average consumer. Polished, finished and long enough. It's what Oculus is aiming for

It makes a complete sense to pay devs for exclusives for both platforms, it's good for consumers, devs and good for VR. I'm 200% sure we'll see much more Steam or Vive exclusives in near future and it's great!

What we need right now, is not an ideal world fulled of open-source, charity and 'good games are selling themselves' bullshit, but A LOT of great VR content. 

It could be archived only with  tech companies pouring money for dev. And Oculus success(as a pioneer and highest profile VR company out there) is crucial for VR success. If Oculus fails in near term -- VR fails and fails hard to death

So, please, try to think outside a box and care about not you don't having some games on your devices, but for a greater VR good

When a market is established that would be the time for holy wars, boycotts and other fanboy stuff. We have other problems for this new infant industry that matter and they could be a child killers. And it's not the Oculus business practices",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-06-14 09:47:19

**44 total videos in my sample, 25 focused only on NA. That's roughly 56% with only 14% focused on EU.**

(I decided to gut and rebuild this whole section since the amount of hate I've been getting for just trying to analyse the data a bit was just getting ridiculous.)

Instead:

It would be really nice if we got some people from the EU Riot teams to cover things as well as the NA team does, it would really help to build the personality of the EU scene a bit more with something like ""Deficio's analysis of the playoff teams"" (with a better name obviously).

I'm not attacking either Riot NA or EU. Riot NA does a great job promoting their region and we can only speculate why it is that Riot EU produces this significant amount less so it would be unfair to target either region obviously.

All playlists can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/LoLChampSeries/playlists) so if you wish to tell me that I've omitted certain results to favour my conclusion please point out which unfavourable results I have omitted without explaining why I have done so.

>I've omitted 4 mic checks for NA (opposed to 0 for EU) on the basis that there might simply not have been games worth covering to that extent in EU (I don't remember if there were or not).

> I've omitted 28 NA spotlight videos compared to 21 EU spotlight videos as the counterpart. I didn't include these on the basis that both regions were equally represented in terms of having playlists that spotlight players and general things like that.

> I didn't include the ""Phreak on the street"" playlist but I feel like I should have done - I only didn't on the basis that it wasn't to do with players or pro teams but now looking at it, it is just more content from NA. So that's 3 more for NA which I omitted.

Still, I'll write everything down for those who don't wanna watch the video.

First of all, I wanna point out that I dislike answering drama, but this got to a point where it surpassed the 'drama' word.
Now it's not drama anymore, It's him making people believe I'm something that I'm not.

Anything. Listen, anything you've readed about me coming out of this guy's fingers is either 1. Taken out of context. or 2. A filthy lie.

The TL'DR of this is: ""I'm happy. 
I never owed money; I don't owe money, and I will NEVER owe money to anyone. I'm consecuent and a man of his word.
I love every human being. I have no proves of this whatsoever. Only the words of those who share life with me or ever met me. In no case my idea was to make harm or show hate. I repeat it, I Love every single human being, does not matter what the conditions are.
This means that my love for Homosexual humans is infinite. Does not matter what.
Same goes for my love for humans with mental illness. I love them, I treat them as good as I know, and I help them everytime the chance appears.
Saying anything different than this IS a lie.


I also understand ls's PoV and his actions, and I can understand the reason he wants this much spotlight. 
With a lease to pay and jobless, a move is needed to comeback on track. Before he was jobless, now he's in the spotlight and with possibly a couple of job offers.
Survival instinct. Kill or die.

Now I actually look back and remember that story about Tom Cruise, that other story about Benzema and his family, the other one about Ronaldo Nazario... And many more of (always) succesful people, and say: ""yeah, that was probably false.""
""Our TV"" is Reddit. Reddit decides who is right or wrong for the eyes of the public, no matter if it's true or false.

In fact, I'm planning to make a streaming session on Sunday 9th November with this earning details:
- 40% of the income will go to http://iglhrc.org/ (International Gay & Lesbian human rights commission).
- 40% of the income will go to http://www.nami.org/ (National Alliance on Mental Illness).
- Additionally, 20% of the income will go to lastshadow's flat Lease Rent.

To finish this TL'DR, think carefully:
- Why would I risk the perception people has about me, my fame or my name for a couple of hundred dollars?
Not to put more wood in the fire but, luckily for me, I have no problems whatsoever keeping up with much higher payments than that one daily.

I am happy. My family is happy. My teammates and workers are happy. My old workers will never come out and say I didn't pay them or treated them wrong.
I wake up happy, I go to bed happy.
Working for my dreams, without having to creep like a snake for a couple of pennys. Leaving no corpses behind me, but happiness and joy. Blizzard, SK Gaming, Riot Games, Turtle Entertainment (ESL), any of my older teammates, or anyone I've met Anywhere in my life, can confirm.


I'm also hot blooded, and an angry motherfucker when these things happen (especially when I have nothing to do with it), but it literally lasts 5 minutes. Yes, those are very stupid rough and nonsense 5 minutes. But then I go to my little meditation corner, and drive myself away from those negative thoughs.
Yes, I threatened him with ""denying his entrance anywhere near eSports"" which was a very stupid thing to say. But in no situation I would actually do that after those 5 minutes of hot spanish blood tension. 
In no way I will EVER harm anybody on purpose. Especially when the situation colds out. I'm not that person.
This, and 'overtrusting' people were my biggest mistakes in this situation.

I got suggested by my lawyers to sue this guy. Everything would actually look good to win it myself, but honestly, it's not in my plans to make this guy's life more miserable than how it is right now.
All I want is him to come out and say the truth, and stop the bleeding. Not even that, I just want him to stop stabbing to stop the bleed.


I'd also like to apologize to all those who missunderstood the whole situation and though I meant any harm towards any specific group. 
It was not my intention. At all. And actually this message is directed mostly to you.""



Said this, I'd like those who crossed a word with me, worked with me, or simply shared their lifes with me at any point of their lifes, to come to this reddit thread and be honest about how I behaved or treated them.

I feel grateful towards the opportunity eSports and its community gave me to become something greater than just a man with a life.
Now I can make a change in the world, making other's lifes better.



Thank you :)

Can we finally get some tighter moderation on blatant racism? r/dota2 has regressed to a cesspool.,108,5d3mit,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5d3mit/can_we_finally_get_some_tighter_moderation_on/,821,1479229531.0,"I'm delighted to see the **abhorrent** racist apologists on the front page put into their place by a mod. The scene has been gradually developing towards an insufferable environment for anyone not d'accord for what basically passes as white supremacy at best, fascism at worst. You quite literally have people in that thread claiming antisemitism is not racism because Jews are not a race and dropping N-bombs ain't that big a deal because dem blacks do it all the time. The amount of ignorance and miseducation is mind-boggling, there is no other way to put it. Being subject to racial abuse (whether casual racism or blatant racism) is horrific and at this point, not even memers like Gorman find it particularly funny. Humour doesn't excuse racist remarks. Rather, it appears to have turned into a poor pretense to just spout any racist garbage while avoiding confrontations since your statement was for the LULS to begin with.



EDIT: Thanks for all the contributions. I think this thread served its function of raising some awareness for the matter pretty effectively. The amount of hateful comments I received (hateful private messages too) and still receive should give some insight into how low the moral standards of some people in this sub are. 
Generally, belittling racism with the most absurd explanations that defy any logic, rationale and historical context like ""words are just sounds, they mean nothing unless you lend them power"" are an insult to everyone's intelligence and should just be avoided. Also, I find the dichotomy of people accusing ""SJW""s of being overly sensitive while being responsible for 80% of the outrage themselves in this thread rather interesting. So far, very few if any compelling reasons have been stated as to why the sanctity of racial abuse in the light of ""jokes"" is more important than treating minorities or any ethnic groups with respect, but yeah. I certainly fail to see how the bigots on here are the true victims but I'm open to all suggestions.",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-11-15 11:05:31

An attempt to boost Elo need not be successful in order to qualify as a rule violation. 

The accounts CLG shared were Platinum. When discovered, Aphro's account specifically was Platinum 5. Is there a reason you chose to consider it account sharing and not elo-boosting?

Was it to not punish CLG in LCS play?

Looks like the boosted the elo of their accounts to play against high level Koreans, right? That's pretty much their consideration. 

Under your definition of elo-boosting, this applies. Here's your definition of account sharing which doesn't seem to apply here:

> The following does not constitute Elo-boosting:
•Permanently transferring a high-Elo account to a less-skilled player. This is illegal, but it’s in the nature of account-sharing and/or account-selling, not account-boosting.

**Edit: Thank you for the gold, kind person who appreciates a different perspective.**

**Edit 2: I believe CLG boosted accounts without the intent to boost them for a client. I believe they boosted those accounts with the intent to play in high Korean elo. 

Ask yourselves. What would have happened to those accounts when CLG returned home? Do those accounts get returned to the user with a  much higher MMR?**",controversial_subreddit,1,2014-08-12 09:35:51

This is what went wrong with the launch - insider confession,93,4ei5vx,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/4ei5vx/this_is_what_went_wrong_with_the_launch_insider/,1125,1460494664.0,"I have been closely involved in Oculus launch preparation. It would be unwise for me to disclose the exact nature of my relationship with Oculus, but I can say I have been directly exposed to the whole process and know enough do give you details. I am making this confession because there has been so much disinformation, FUD and accusations on the internet recently and because I believe community deserves a proper explanation (and you are hopefully going understand why Oculus cannot do that directly).


**Fist of all:** the mysterious ""missing component"". This vague statement refers to Xbox One Controller + Wireless Adapter.
While it might sound ridiculous that such ubiquitous accessory could be in short supply, it is important to understand that this device is manufactured in a very precise batches based on the demand simulations. Such predictions are relatively easy to make, as demand for Xbox One console + additional controllers sold via retail is pretty much constant and it does not fluctuate a lot outside of holiday season. Having strict production volume control in place allows to avoid expensive 'overstocking' (warehouse fees and overhead) and enables having streamlined, optimal and efficient manufacturing line (which brings further cost advantage). Additionally, Wireless Adapter is produced in much lower volume, as it targets relatively small market of PC gamers, mostly enthusiasts.


**Second thing:** all Rift components (HMD itself, camera, controller, boxes and so on) are delivered directly to one of the local distribution centers (US, EU, AUS/ASIA and so on) where final QA, packaging and shipping to the customers is done. They all come from different sources and locations, but till recently everything has been going well.


**Thirdly:** To give you some idea of the volume we are talking about here, day-one preorders are in the ballpark (huh) of 300K units - these are to be shipped ASAP (the actual backlog is larger). This figure is almost quarterly production volume for Xbox Controller Wireless Adapter (I think you can see now where all of this is heading...).

We were promised about 100K Controller + Adapter units delivered by Microsoft directly to the distribution centres at the end of Feb + regular monthly batches thereafter and were advised multiple times that everything is on track. When shipment date was getting close, shocking truth was revealed: due to ""omission"" by Microsoft stocking department, ""our"" batch of controllers was actually never allocated and reserved - there was simply nothing to ship! This was absolutely shocking case of mismanagement.

Then the hell broke loose. Countless conference calls later it was clear that there is no chance for MS to deliver any substantial volume of units at least until the end of the March. This was definitively the most stressful period in my career ever, it was already March, we had no controllers to put in the boxes and the atmosphere was very tense. At this point literally every single possible solution was evaluated. Microsoft was able to provide a few thousands units on a very short notice, but this was not nearly enough. Additionally, all sort of wholesale (and even retail) vendors were approached, with some success - so that is why small batches of the Rifts (mostly for Kickstarter backers) were actually sent out.

There was discussion if Xbox controllers should just be replaced with ""vouchers"" in the box entitling customers to claim Xbox controller later, either in one of the retail outlets or via Oculus Store, but this idea was eventually dismissed as: a) it would be too complicated logistically, especially on such short notice b) it would immediately reveal that MS is to blame for the situation, which they absolutely wanted to avoid c) most agreed that news headlines like ""Oculus shipping slower than expected"" sound better than ""Oculus (or worse: Facebook) is shipping incomplete product"" (while this might sound silly, it is very important for publicly traded company).

The main reason why no announcement was made earlier is because it was not clear how many controllers can be retrieved from alternative sources until very recently and assumption was made that Microsoft is going to deliver by the end of March. Manufacturing and shipping issues during product development are not uncommon (you get used to them in this business) and there was a good hope that the whole fiasco could be avoided. Additionally, it turned out that big Chinese retailer has a decent stash of controllers and dongles at their disposal, which sounded like a good backup plan. With all of this in mind, '1-3 weeks' emails were sent out, so it would allow us to buy some time when hopefully everything gets happily resolved in the background. However, this hope did not materialize: it turned out it would not be possible to get controllers from China on time (all sort of issues: customs, paperwork, company being 'difficult' to work with) and delivery from Microsoft slipped (again...). Of course in hindsight this was not the best way to handle things, but at that point it really looked like it would be possible to get away with minimum (if any) delay.

Eventually, when the alternative options failed, at the end of March the decision was made that:

- we keep trying to fetch as many controllers as possible from alternative sources to keep the orders flowing (albeit at excruciatingly slow pace)

- customers will be refunded shipping fees - this gets partially covered by Microsoft, as they agreed to provide substantial discount on (already discounted) controllers due to their mismanagement

- further update will be made on 04/12, after big batch of Rifts + controllers from early April delivery is QA'd, packed and ready to be shipped to the customers (the idea was to start dispatching large batches from 04/12, but it did not go that well...)

Current situation is as follows:

- the overdue, early-April batch of controllers took longer than expected to arrive, but they are here now - about 80K of them were received in distribution centers at the end of last week, with another similar batch coming later this or early next month. After all required processing is done, this will allow us to start shipping orders at full speed starting from the next week (hopefully earlier than later).

- shipping dates you were given today are quite conservative. Unless something goes catastrophically wrong (huh...), your Rift should be dispatched on the first day of the period stated in the email (it **could** be even sooner, but no promises!)  - code on the website simply adds 10 days to the initial date to generate the range in order to allow for some flexibility in case of unexpected problems (we have learned our lesson).

**The most important matter:** Despite all this mess, I want to emphasizes there was never any ill will or conspiracy here. I have got privilege to work with brilliant and extremely talented people who dedicated years of their hard work, with many sleepless night and weekends to make Rift happen. The hope that everything is going to be OK after ""component"" problem was identified was very real and tangible. I think pretty much everyone involved in the project is totally devastated by the current situation (believe, much more than you - even if you think this is not possible). It is unbelievably painful to see the entire precisely engineered product release plan to fall out by one detail that is not even under your control. Despite what you might think, there is a lot of people in the Oculus team who read this sub and they often take opinions here very personally - they dedicated a big part of their life to Rift after all. I can guarantee you that your concerns are being heard and I can only kindly ask you not to judge us and the Rift based on this incident.

I totally agree that communication aspect here could have been handled much better. I am sure if we knew what we know now, completely different decisions would had been made (yes, I know, easy to say now). And now: believe me, the team would love to officially announce what exactly is going on, but contractual agreement absolutely prevent us from disclosing any details about the deal with Microsoft publicly - and this includes nature (or even existence) of any problems, if/when they arise. Despite that, I (and I am sure many others) still feel that we failed the community who put a lot of trust in our words - this is why I am writing this now, although it might not be the most sensible thing to do. Please forgive us. We all learned a lot from this situation and strive to do much better in the future.

Ah, and the last thing: want some ""proof""? Look at the serial numbers of XBox controllers shipped with Rifts so far. While normally range of these numbers should be relatively uniform, as they would be coming from one big preallocated ""chunk"", in fact the number can differ a lot as many of controllers are from the completely different batches - this is an echo of frantic search by Oculus Team for every available Xbox One controller in existence.",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-04-12 15:57:44

I am completely sure that if this amount of offensive comments existed 3 years ago I wouldn't be an esport fan

The official twitch channel of Riot Games has the worst community of the website. What kind of marketing is that?

Don't you dare to tell me that you can't mod 100k viewers because I have seen channels with 100k viewers be moded. Please be mature and add ban words.

Don't tell me to ignore it because this is getting bigger and bigger and is starting to overcome other communities too.

I am sure that we are close to start seeing comments about wishing other people to kill themselves just for being from other region.

Riot talks about sportsmanship and fights against toxicity. Meanwhile, they have allowed a joke evolve to an offensive and toxic fight.

**I don't care if the harsh comment goes towards EU or NA. And it doesn't matter if you are from EU or NA**

I have to admit that I laugh a lot reading twitch chat, I have even laughed a lot reading this thread.

How to be a non reportable toxic player in league of legends.,39,2dsbxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2dsbxm/how_to_be_a_non_reportable_toxic_player_in_league/,247,1408263030.0,"This is guide on how to be a non reportable toxic player in league of legends.

**Champion Select**

* If you are first pick, ban champions that counter your lane or champions you just don't like. Last game did the enemy do really well with [insert champion here]? Ban them. Your team mates might tell you to ban champions like Rengar, jax or Braum but don't worry the enemy will do that for you. 

* Since you're first pick anyways, haven't you always wanted to try out marksman? Seems like the perfect time to test out Twitch, oh even better didn't Gnar just come out? Try him instead.

* Don't bother call a role in champion select, your team should already know where you're going based on your champion. Like Vayne Top, wait until everyone is locked in say ""btw I'm going top"" Your team might get upset but hey it's pick order!  so they'll understand and most likely dodge.

**Entering the rift**

* Wait about 1:30 before actually buying items and walking to lane, this will ensure you won't have to leash your jungler or worry about getting killed if the enemy invades. 

* Level 1 fights. Always try them, you'll win always. Just because you don't have ignite doesn't mean you won't out damage that Darius.

* Pings are your friends, they let your jungler know when you need help. Spam ping as much as you can, like really spam until they gank your lane. If you don't gank then take it upon yourself to 1 v 1 the enemy again.

**/Mute all**

* It's your best friend, when your team starts flaming you for going 0/9/1 by 15 mins but don't worry you still have late game. 

**Play the Victim**  

* One phrase will get you off the hook ""I'm having a bad game"" Those are the magical words that will make the people of the tribunal press pardon every time. 

* Use the word ""Toxic"" every second, you didn't follow up on the gank cause you didn't feel like it causing your jungler to die and he starts flaming you? Just say ""This lee so toxic omg, I'm sorry"" Your team will take your side no matter what.

* Also give your team encouraging words so when you feed it's okay, along the lines of ""we have late game"" or ""Don't worry we got this never surrender"" while being 0/10/2

**Never Group**

* Split pushing wins games, you've seen on youtube that trynd single handedly ending the game out pushing 5 other people. Well that's gonna be you! 

* You're the tank, you always die every team fight. Grouping isn't necessary any more, just keep on spilt pushing. Just spam ping your team to fall back as you remain top. 

**Copy Random Builds**

* Remember that Korean ad malp build? try it out. It works. You'll win lane. Always.

* Did you know when you buy a nashtooth on Prime Time Draven he says a cool quote? Try it out in ranked. Do it.

**Jungle**

* Always do one man invades and attempt to counter jungle before clearing your own camps first. If you die just say to mid ""dude, map awareness"" He'll start to flame you but just mute him and never gank ever again. Now you're building your flare. 

* Don't bother start a jungler item, they're stupid and pointless. Go Dorans or sword pots. 

* When your team mates back, push their lane but never hit the enemy turret. 

**Supporting**

* Screw the Gold income item, it's useless late game.

* Your adc sucks at csing, you should take so you can be tanky for team fights.

* Take every kill and type ""oops"" after

* Wards? You can ward the tri bush THAT ALL. Never ward any where else ever.

* Go damage, your team needs it. Ap Thresh here we go!

**Marksman**

* All marksman are the same, pick anyone. 

* Front line in every team fight

* Never follow up with the jungler, he never pinged so you don't have to do shit

* Don't bother freeze the lane, you need the cs you can get. Even if you have wards or not just keep pushing hard. Sometimes you'll miss most of it but that's alright. Late game will come.

* Start triforce on every marksman, even cait.

**Fighter/Tank**

* Call tank in champion select then go damage, your team will understand that you need to carry.

* Initiate at every chance you get, no matter how low you are or your team is. Even if it's a 2v4, go in it's your job!

* Focus their tank, why do you think you're building armor pen for?

* Play Riven or Yasuo for the first time. 

* You don't need wards, most top laners have escapes. 

* If they tell you to build tank, its because they don't want to carry.

* Fuck team fights, push lanes. 

* Fuck lanes, jump in team fights. 

**Mage**

* You need to push your lane!! You have no time for wards!!!

* Burst down their tank, he's after your marksman!

* You don't need boots until about 25 mins in game

* Don't bother roaming. 

* Don't bother push either.

* Take your jungler camps, he won't need them.

* Start double dorans, Chalice, Tear and Valor. So you'll never run out of mana.

* When you see your jungler being invaded, head for top. Then say sorry.

Stop posting American carrier bullshit,1315,1um5uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1um5uh/stop_posting_american_carrier_bullshit/,1199,1389089239.0,"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ujxfc/us_tmobile_will_buy_over_3_billion_in_700mhz/) thread is number 1 on /r/android right now but has nothing to do with Android. It doesn't mention any Android device, in fact the word 'Android' is nowhere to be found.

Carrier-specific posts are bad enough, and I also think those should be removed. Or the millions Motorola threads which don't apply to anyone outside of America. But this is a carrier and country specific post that *doesn't even have anything to do with Android*. Yeah you can use an Android on T-mobile - you can use an iPhone or a Windows Phone or a fucking Nokia 3310 as well. There's nothing Android specific here.

It's just American carrier rubbish again. Almost *nothing* except blogspam is allowed on this subreddit as it is, but *this* is permitted? Give me a break.

It has nothing to do with Android and only serves to reinforce the Android community and Google's attitude of 'America is the only country'. It's like if I own an Android I HAVE to be American and there's no other possibility. You don't find this shit in the other phone subreddits and you shouldn't find it here.


edit: Okay, I've tried to support my argument and respond to comments, but no matter how much I explain and justify, every single thing I write is immediately getting downvoted heavily, so I'm gonna have my comments limited soon. So I'm out for now, I guess. I strongly suggest however that we consider making and enforcing simpler and more consistent rules that are designed to benefit the community as a whole.

"Unpopular opinion: If you're running solo, and you get killed by a group of 4 rogues... it's your own fault.",85,4i5m96,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/4i5m96/unpopular_opinion_if_youre_running_solo_and_you/,661,1462548908.0,"Very tired of seeing solo players complain about what is the central idea of the DZ. I run solo 50% of the time and have very little issue with bumping into rogues. My secret; stay the hell away from people. 

There are other bosses that spawn regularly outside of the landmarks - learn where those are so that if other groups are cleaning up landmarks you don't get jumped by them. Extract somewhere that hasn't seen a lot of action lately. Study your map so that when rogue icons pop up you know how close/far away they are or what extractions zone they are camping. 

Running solo is actually pretty easy, it just requires a little more awareness. Occasionally you will get jumped and occasionally you will lose. However, it's that tension that SHOULD make the game fun - and as long as you play smart it won't happen often. 

Also - just because you kill 2 rogues who failed to ambush you doesn't mean you're a community hero. Rogues help make the game fun, stop acting like this is r/justiceporn. 

Lastly, if you REALLY can't handle it solo... use matchmaking or find another solo player and shoot them an invite, or convince a friend to play with you. 


.

**EDIT:** 
An argument I hear often: ""If you're a group of 4, you shouldn't be picking on solo players. Man-up and take on another group.""

Counter argument: If you're a rogue and see a solo player that just killed a boss an opened a chest and your farming for matts, or hoping for a lucky drop - these people are EXACTLY the targets you want to see. It's not about a ""fair fight"" it's about getting the best stuff. Not to mention the server will be chasing you down soon enough.

**EDIT 2:** I'm slowly watching the points on this post drop (already) which I expected. But to those downvoting I have to simply ask - what do you expect in the DZ?

**EDIT 3:** u/Freaking_poulet has some pretty good tips for people learning to run solo [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/4i5dvk/a_guide_for_new_lvl30_solo_dz_players/)

**EDIT 4**: I'm happy to see some really good discussion. There are a few obviously salty people who it looks like are downvoting basically anything I post and anyone with a similar opinion while not contributing, ~~but aside from that I'm actually really happy to see that even opposing viewpoints have kept it moderately civil~~ (nope, not anymore. People are straight up attacking each other and calling each other ""retarded"" now. This is the toxicity of this sub in it's finest). I agree that PVE players need some additional love to this game outside of the DZ - but I think the DZ should reward players with a higher drop rate or slightly better loot since there is a higher risk.

**EDIT 5** - Final Edit: This has been fun. I've tried to reply to as many posts as possible and man this has been a roller-coaster. I think at the peak this had 100 points, and is currently at about 62 with a lot of up and downs in-between. I think this just goes to show how divided the community is on WHAT the DZ SHOULD be.",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-05-06 10:35:08

"Every aspect of WoW is currently broken, from leveling, to raiding, and even PvP.",40,2jafrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2jafrg/every_aspect_of_wow_is_currently_broken_from/,764,1413347702.0,"**I know it sounds absurd, but seriously read this full post.** I have no idea how they could mess it up this badly. I have played this game from Vanilla till Mists of Pandaria. 5.4 MoP in my opinion has been the best gaming experience out of any in the warcraft timeline or any games timeline. Yes, even better than Vanilla or BC.

Unfortunately now, everything is broken and it doesn't look like there will be a fix coming any time soon because the flaws are incredibly deep. Let's list all of the problems:

Leveling - Questing

* Leveling up a new character right now is one of the worst experiences. Killing mobs takes twice as long, and as such, the entire leveling process has just been effectively doubled. Remember when you could triple pull enemies at your level to get more kills and items to complete your quests? Now you are back to killing one mob at a time at insanely slow speeds. Also, if you are a class without a heal, avoid taking damage at all costs. Tons of mobs can quickly kill you.

* Many mobs have abilities that are unsquished. For example, the bunny guys in the Valley of the Four Winds can one shot even an item level 580 tank. Their bite DoT is unsquished. There are literally hundreds of mobs like this.

Leveling - Dungeons

* Previously we could fly through every 5 man dungeon, quickly get loot and experience for leveling up. Now, even with a group geared to the teeth with full heirlooms can't beat a 5 man without insane luck. Almost every single dungeon enemy can 2 shot the tank - and this isn't just unsquished random abilities. Our stats are effectively many times lower than the corresponding dungeon tuning.

Raiding - Outdoor

* Ordos and the Celestial Bosses are now a huge pain in the ass. Remember that fire underneath Ordos that everyone sat in while facerolling him because we had the gear and the healers to back us up? Well now that fire is not squished properly and kills you in 5 ticks. It literally does 30K damage a tick. Good luck. Yu'lon's green goo also with kill you in a couple seconds too. I have no idea how Blizzard could have missed this.

* In general, these bosses die twice as fast as before, but the players die four times as fast. Huge heals need to be preemptive and spammed because the tuning a totally different ballgame now.

Raiding - Indoor

* ToES is now uncompletable because the last two bosses have unsquished mechanics. They will one shot you endlessly even on the easiest of difficulties.

* Heart of Fear has many amber shapers which require you to free a raid member by attacking them. It's too bad the amber shell is unsquished and has 6 million health. Hint: you won't be able to break it.

* ToT has some adds before Durumu that will one shot the entire raid again, even on LFR difficulty.

* SoO has many tuning issues in people getting one shot by nearly every boss since everything dies so fast and heals so fast. Burst damage and healing is really bad for this game. Also the Iron Stars in garrosh's room deal 350K+ damage on any difficulty. Yeah. 350,000 damage while we have around 100K health.

PvP - Arenas

* Arenas are a burst fest since there is no resilience and we all kill each other in two hits. A rouge ambushed me for 50K. I have 75K health. He then silences me with a kick, doesn't need to stun me, and hits again for 25K, you die. It isn't just rogue's that can kill people fast - It's everyone. Also, even mediocre healing spells heal you to full. The game is now about silences. I can get out of a CC or stun by using my trinket. Most healers can even use a move while stunned, like monk's Life Cocoon. But a 4 second silence is all you need to murder someone, since they can't get out of it and you kill people in two hits.

PvP - Battlegrounds

* Well the server is currently offline, but when it was working it was just as bad as Arenas. I hope you are a ranged class, because the melee melt instantly! Also, Alterac Valley has level 98 elite mobs instead of the ones meant for our level. Balinda can one shot the entire Horde army in one spell! How fun!

Pre-Expansion Questline

* I'm used to pre-expansion quest lines being kinda lame, but this one takes the cake. The UBRS server is like russian roulette. It kicks out people completely randomly with no questions asked and the new questline takes about 5 minutes to complete. The only cool thing you can do is get into UBRS, pray that you don't get kicked, and start killing some of the level 101 ogre's inside. They drop really high item level greens (580+), and a cooking book!

TLDR - Go read whatever part of the game you are interested in above to learn how it is completely broken.

The heart of the problem is the number squish. They have done it in such a way that everyone's health is a pinball machine that bounces between near death and full. Every hit you take reduces you to half hp. Every heal you take brings you to full. Healers notice this the most because they have to constantly try to predict damage and spam huge heals constantly. The tank's hp is literally all over the place. Duels often last less than 5 seconds. A 2v2 double DPS team can kill ANY healer in a single 4 second silence break in healing. They really do die that fast. 3v3 and up is only worse. Undoing the number squish is the first step in restoring sanity, but I believe Blizzard isn't going to make this change. They need the numbers to be smaller for the server computations and this may ultimately destroy WoW, save for some insane detailed number tweaking...

Athene Should Think Before He Speaks - Comments from a Pro,272,32gmt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/32gmt3/athene_should_think_before_he_speaks_comments/,709,1428945367.0,"Hey Guys,

Dart here again with a random post about someone that I have actually enjoyed watching since well back in his WoW paladin days. Now I will admit, I think Athene is hilarious. He is extremely charitable and is great at what he does. I don't think I have ever personally disagreed with his actions, up until he posted this video that made front page of reddit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GilVjOEk8Fc

In this video, Athene says that it is easy to play ""perfect"" in Hearthstone and that it requires little-to-no skill. He diminishes everything that many of the pro's have accomplished in this game. I have been playing this game for over a year now, at what I consider close to the top level, and still find myself making mistakes. He bases his assumptions off of the fact that he got to legend??? I apologize to those who are unable to get to legend themselves, but doing so does not require even a fraction of the top level skill required to excel in this game. 

I am currently watching Athene drop to the absolute pits of legend, ranks 500+ as he fails to win with even the easiest of decks to play, face hunter. He makes many mistakes and does not even seem to realize that they were mistakes at all. 

Now I know more posts about him only boosts his ego and viewership, but I am okay with that. He is a good guy who does a lot for the esports community and donates a lot of money towards children in need. 

So what is the point of this post? Athene, if you read this, I want to challenge you to a match (Bo5 or more) to prove the immense difference in caliber between a player like you and someone like me (and many others who deserve recognition for their skill level). If I win, I want a open apology towards the Hearthstone community saying that you pale in comparison to the majority of players in the game. I do not care if you stream the match or not, but I want you to realize that the competitive atmosphere of this game is not a joke.

Message me on twitter if you are not afraid of getting shown up by a no-name medical student who barely has time to play anymore:

News from Palestine and Israel for July 14th / 15th,25,2aqd5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aqd5x/news_from_palestine_and_israel_for_july_14th_15th/,1531,1405395334.0,"This topical news sticky is **part 2** of an experiment** /r/worldnews is going to run today. 

Yesterday we ran an experiment of using a sticky in contest mode.  The feedback within that thread was pretty evenly divided between people who liked it, and people who didn't. The feedback we've gotten via modmail was majority positive.

There are two significant complaints that shared by people on both sides. You did not like contest mode, because you want to be able to sort by new and you felt there was not as much discussion. 

So now we are going for a another trial period of one day to see if a regular thread listed as a sticky is a workable approach.

For those who missed the previous sticky, here are some issues we've been experiencing that led to this decision:

1. We've recently been overwhelmed with submissions about Palestine and Israel. Hence, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep /r/worldnews a place for news from around the world. Our subscribers have made it clear they are annoyed by how one topic dominates the sub, especially in the new queue.

2. Users have also been complaining en masse that some content related to this topic may have been attacked by downvote brigades and effectively been silenced this way.  Moderators have no tools to determine if this is actually the case or not but at our request the reddit administrators have investigated and told us they see no evidence of vote manipulation.  This has not alleviated many users' concerns.

3. Due to the sheer number of submissions, discussions of the current events are being spread out across several threads with the same arguments playing out across all of them.



### **Special rules apply for top-level comments in this sticky today:**

- **All top-level comments must consist of an article link only.** Be sure to use reddit formatting to turn text into a link to your article - do not just post the URL link.  Those will be removed.

- The articles should be relevant to the topic and follow the regular submission rules.  Articles should be news, not opinion or analysis and should be current.

- Memes or just images will be removed as usual.

- The link title may be customized, but should describe/quote the article and may not exceed 300 characters.

- If you edit your top level comment after any votes or replies, it will be subject to removal.

- If you encounter duplicate submissions, please send us both permalinks in the body of a [mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fworldnews).  We will then remove the duplicate.

 
If you submit a story about Israel or Palestine as a regular submission like you used to, it will automatically be removed, a flair ""use sticky"" will be attached and you'll be redirected to this thread in a comment reply.
 
**All current [/r/worldnews comment rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) will still apply here.**

What if scoring a S+ increases your chance for a Key Fragment to 100%?,301,4efn55,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4efn55/what_if_scoring_a_s_increases_your_chance_for_a/,481,1460460343.0,"Getting a S Rank is quite common, but scoring a S+ is actually pretty hard and usually doesn't happen frequently. It would be cool if you could get a small bonus reward by achieving such a Rank.  
Note, this is not a Bonus Key Fregment, you can only get one Key Fragment per Game and getting one with a S+ will decrease the Chance of getting a new Fragment as usual.  
I don't think you can really abuse this, because the Mastery System actually works pretty good and even if you could find a way to farm Key Fragments, you will still be limited by the Chests. Also Riot could always add a monthly limit to it.",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-04-12 06:25:43

CLG is being bashed by the same people for 2 years, all new posts involving Elements involve ton of shitposts since the forming of the team (ALL), SK got bashed pretty hard for not shoving in playoffs, Coast was just meme whole season, just like Liquid was until playoffs. 

And now everyone is so disgusted by all the hate TSM got. If you play bad you get flamed bad, just deal with it. Other teams at least didn't pretend to be hot sh1t. All was hyped by fans, nor Froggen nor any other ALL player said that they will crush everyone (reddit created hype themselves and when it didn't happen - blame others), but what they got was even worse than what TSM is getting.

And no, no one who have at least some knowledge of the scene predicted TSM to go top 2. They said they can do it, but honestly, I haven't seen anyone to prefer TSM over SKT or EDG, just wishful and pitiful NA personas (hoping that trashing NA means something in context of international strenght). TSM had best chance ever to finish top 2, but it still was far-fetched.

And at last. I wish for trashtalking segments. Good trashtalking, not TSM-like. In LCK everything is prepared for the hype and text is witty, funny. TSM just bash.

Everyone has been asking me what I thought about famous controversial artist Richard Prince taking a series of SuicideGirls instagram posts and printing them out and selling them at a recent gallery show at the gagosian gallery of beverly hills for $90,000 a piece.

My first thought was I don’t know anyone who can spend $90,000 on anything other than a house. Maybe I know a few people who can spend it on a car. As to the copyright issue? If I had a nickel for every time someone used our images without our permission in a commercial endeavour I’d be able to spend $90,000 on art. I was once really annoyed by Forever 21 selling shirts with our slightly altered images on them, but an Artist? 

Richard Prince is an artist and he found the images we and our girls publish on instagram as representative of something worth commenting on, part of the zeitgeist, I guess? Thanks Richard!

Do we have Mr. Prince’s permission to sell these prints? We have the same permission from him that he had from us. ;)

I’m just bummed that his art is out of reach for people like me and the people portrayed in the art he is selling.

So we at SuicideGirls are going to sell the exact same prints people payed $90,000 for $90 each.

I hope you love them. Beautiful Art, 99.9% off the original price. ;)

EDIT: Thanks for all the questions and nice words about SG I'm done after 7 hours. :)

HERE IS MY REPLY TO THE QUESTIONS I DIDN'T GET TO :)

I am really sorry I was not trying to dodge any questions, I DID actually reply to the top question initially my reply is just buried.  :)   I answered questions for 7 hours and the ones that were at the top during that time were about the Richard Prince issue I set up my IAMA about.  These comments and upvotes came up after I had signed off so I missed them but can answer them now in more detail.  

About 10 years ago a handful of the thousands of models on my site felt slighted and went to a competitor site.  We were sad to see them go, they were friends, it sucked, it felt personal and it hurt and it was lame.  We handled things the way that we felt at the time was best, but would we do the same things now, probably not.  We learned from the experience and in the ensuing decade people have come and gone largely without incident, we get it, life changes, interests change, dreams and goals shift and girls and photographers leave.  Most of the time amiably, occasionally not, but I genuinely wish everyone well. 

The non-compete clause, honestly when I started the company I went off of Playboy’s release form, I was 24 had never done this before and thought that seemed like the industry standard.  We thought it was too confusing when it was challenged and we changed our release form in 2006 and it has been the same super simple, clear easy to read contract since then you can see it here - https://gmail123456.box.com/s/qbmj1f9pr3w8w8wzaj5e   My intent is not to fuck anyone over, if someone decides to model for a competitor I wish them well and we part ways, end of story.  

We are up front about our policies, pay scale and use of images, if you are interested you can see the answers to most questions here: https://suicidegirls.com/model/faq/ or here https://suicidegirls.com/model/faq/photographer/  And if you need further clarification we have a 3 person staff to answer your questions, they can be directed to either modelcoordinator@suicidegirls.com, modelassist@suicidegirls.com or photographycoordinator@suicidegirls.com  If you don’t think it is a good deal for you, I get it, no hard feelings but that is what we pay and what we ask.  

We have had thousands of models and photographers who have had great experiences working with us here are some links that detail their experiences -

https://suicidegirls.com/members/albertine/blog/2754147/a-decade/

https://suicidegirls.com/members/vayda/blog/2816598/sghw-how-has-sg-changed-your-life/

And a few who’ve had complicated experiences that spark discourse (read the comments) - https://suicidegirls.com/members/dwam/blog/2819390/so-how-has-sg-changed-my-life/

Then there are some who have not had great experiences and felt slighted by us, and it sucks that we can’t reach an accord.  Lithium Picnic was someone who we had a disagreement with and it took time to reach an agreement.  We eventually did settle things and he has moved on and so have we and I genuinely hope that he is doing well.  

We get that what we do is not for everyone.  We try to provide a platform where people can express themselves in a supportive community and connect with like minded people.  We try to be upfront with our expectations but sometimes people don’t agree with what we do or decisions and there is an impasse.  Sometimes I am wrong and sometimes I fuck up and I make the wrong call and the only thing to do is to try to learn from my mistakes.  I have also learned that there are sometimes though you just can’t make people happy no matter what you do.  I am trying to be a better person every day though but some days are better than others.  Generally though my reputation amongst those who have actually dealt with me in the past is positive despite what it says about me on wikipedia and I have gone through enough therapy that I am okay with that. :)

Finally you would once again like to use this opportunity to question my involvement with the company, alright I can answer that too (even if it is so fucking sexist it makes me want to scream, no man would ever have to defend his position in his own fucking company 14+ years in)  Yeah Sean is my partner and has been since we started the company and he is a pretty cool dude most of the time ;) He does council me and we do make decisions together and he is very particular about design and he and Courtney Riot who has worked with us for 12 years pretty much do all of that.  I run the day to day operations of the company, ask my staff, ask the models who come by the office, or look at my nearly 15 years of ever present history.  My staff is overwhelmingly female and I am female so that is where the female run thing comes from, because it IS female run.  I do press because I am in the office everyday and started and run the company.  

I really hope that answers all of the questions, I honestly did not mean to dodge them and I hope that you enjoy turning the tables on Richard Prince with us.  That is getting WAY more attention than I anticipated and I am going to be a bit swamped for the next few days, so I probably won’t be able to engage in follow up questions here but if you need something answered you can e-mail me, I will reply, eventually :)",controversial_subreddit,1,2015-05-27 14:52:18

No, I'm not a LoL player. Yes, I am a Dota guy - but I love you all. I love the support you show for e-sports, I love how Riot and the community has glamorized the concept over the years, and I love your dedication to the game you love. But there comes a point when you all need to collectively put your foot down.

What not enough of you guys are realizing is that it's all about ROI. You can't buy a working loading screen, or a flashy new client. You don't buy the help tab, it's just there. Even if Riot only needed to send two dudes to fix that shit on a Thursday, they'd see no returns. When they instead send 30 dudes to make a champ, you buy it. Or make a skin, you buy it. Or shuffle the meta, you'll rebuy into it. See what I'm getting at?

I'm not saying Riot is money-grubbing evil or anything, but the reality of being for-profit doesn't help. You guys need to put your money where your mouth is. On /r/Dota2, people constantly talk about boycott. Servers down? Not buying the cosmetics. Tired of Dota esports? Not buying the compendium. There are seriously strong movements of fed up people who are voting with their wallets and making changes. When Valve changed the item drop system, giving us less **free** cosmetics (boo hoo, right?), and trade restrictions were put in place, people voted with their wallets. Valve reverted a lot of the more heinous changes recently, and it's probably because it did cut into their profits.

It's not easy to stop supporting something you love, I know, but you come off as spineless when you're taken advantage of. I've seen client complaints hit the front page for years now. It doesn't take years to make a new client. Fuck, Valve has taken a year break from making major Dota 2 updates so they can finish **a new fucking engine**, all while working heavily on 3-4 different games, maintaining Steam, Steam Machines, etc. I think it's easy to see that, as an outsider, you all are being given the run around.

New Ad Type: Promoted User Posts,0,4upf11,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/,2199,1469549542.0,"**TL;DR - [here is what this ad is](https://i.redd.it/dyib2c0odmbx.png)**

Hi all,
 
We’ve been working on some new ad products. When we’re thinking about new ad products, we want to ensure that what we’re creating is non-intrusive to you guys while remaining valuable to advertisers who are interested in participating in the community.
 
In conversations with many advertisers, we often hear that Redditors have already rallied around brands and products they genuinely like, and advertisers want to know how they can be part of that. But at the same time, we want to ensure that our communities remain free and user-controlled.
 
The solution, which we’re excited to share, is a new type of advertisement that we’re calling Promoted User Posts. This will essentially let an advertiser identify an organic post that they find especially relevant to their brand or product, and promote that in the Sponsored unit you guys are already used to. 

How it works:

* A redditor creates a post with brand-relevant content
* A brand notices the post and indicates to our sales team that they’re interested in promoting the post
* Our sales team reaches out to the author of the post to get explicit permission to use the post as part of a promoted user post
* If permission is given, a promoted user post is created by copying over the content and votes of the original post into a new promoted user post. (The comments will link to the same thread.)
* The original post will remain where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.

**Note that no posts created by redditors will be used in this fashion without explicit opt-in approval from the redditor who created the post. Also - votes on the ad will not count towards karma or votes on the organic thread.**

For a screenshot of a hypothetical example, see [here](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png). (Note that Jenga is not a real advertiser at this time.)

Both of these changes will go live on Thursday, August 4. We’ll be speaking with mod teams ahead of time before any user promoted posts go live in their subreddits.

While we’re launching this new avenue for generating more Reddit revenue, we’ll also be shutting down a revenue generating experiment. Our experiment with [affiliate links](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) has ended for the time being. We’ve decided that focusing our energies on advertising is more congruent with our long term strategy.

Thanks for reading, and happy redditing!

Cheers,

u/starfishjenga

**FAQ**

**Q: I don’t want my content used as an advertisement, how do I avoid this?**
No content will be turned into a promoted post without the submitter’s explicit permission. If you don’t want this to happen, either don’t answer or say no when you’re asked.

**Q: What does the promoted by link point to?**
If a brand pays to promote a post, in the bottom right corner where it says ""promoted by"", the advertiser will be linked so that you will know who is promoting the post. Clicking on their name will link to an advertiser-determined location. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png).

**Q: What if my content was originally intended to point somewhere else? Do advertisers have the right to change that? Wouldn’t this change the context of the pre-existing comments?**
Your content won’t be used in this way unless you agree to let it become a promoted user post.

If you’ve commented on a post that becomes a promoted user post, promoted user posts will simply create an additional link to these comments pages. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png).

**Q: What happens to the original votes? Is this a way for companies to juice the number of upvotes to their posts?**
The vote count from the original post will be copied to the promoted post, but any upvotes applied to the promoted post will not be copied back to the original post in order to preserve the integrity of the ranking algorithm.

**Q: What happens to the original post?**
The original post still remains where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.

**Q: What does the link in the promoted post point to?**
Promoting a post does not change the destination of the original link. If it was a self post, it goes to the self post comments page. If it was a link post, it goes to the link destination, same as before. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png)

**Q: Is there a way for us to view where our content was promoted?**
If your content is chosen for promotion and you accept, we’ll give you a link to the promoted user post.

**Q: Do we get anything in return for agreeing to have our post promoted?**
This may vary across content and across time as we figure out what makes the most sense. It will generally take the form of Gold membership for some amount of time.

**Q: Won’t this encourage more users to submit content containing brands (and more fuss from /r/HailCorporate over “shilling”)?**
We don’t believe the rewards on offer are enough to change people’s behavior in this case, but we’ll keep an eye on it and deal with any problems that arise.

We would like to take the opportunity to remind everyone that when AskReddit shut down it was related to issues of mod-admin communication that had been a concern since before Ellen was the CEO. We in no way intended this as a result.

The admins have been extremely positive and appear to be working hard towards giving us better tools and communicating better. We, in particular, want to thank /u/krispykrackers and /u/deimorz for those efforts. Here's to a more positive relationship moving forward.

More importantly, we want to remind you about [“Remembering the Human.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)

It’s a simple concept, which many of us are guilty of forgetting sometimes, but there is no better time than now to stress the importance of it. We wish Ellen the best of luck in her future ventures and are hopeful of the future for the community.

With that said, please use this thread to discuss the change, the effects, and anything else related to the news. 

All top level comments must be questions.

Removing harassing subreddits,0,39bpam,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/,28710,1433959311.0,"Today we are announcing a change in community management on reddit. Our goal is to enable as many people as possible to have authentic conversations and share ideas and content on an open platform. We want as little involvement as possible in managing these interactions but will be involved when needed to protect privacy and free expression, and to prevent harassment.

It is not easy to balance these values, especially as the Internet evolves. We are learning and hopefully improving as we move forward. We want to be open about our involvement:
We will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to [harass](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) individuals when moderators don’t take action. We’re banning behavior, not ideas.

Today we are removing five subreddits that break our reddit rules based on their harassment of individuals. If a subreddit has been banned for harassment, you will see that in the ban notice. The only banned subreddit with more than 5,000 subscribers is r/fatpeoplehate.

To report a subreddit for harassment, please email us at contact@reddit.com or [send a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com).

We are continuing to add to our team to manage community issues, and we are making incremental changes over time. We want to make sure that the changes are working as intended and that we are incorporating your feedback when possible. Ultimately, we hope to have less involvement, but right now, we know we need to do better and to do more. 

While we do not always agree with the content and views expressed on the site, we do protect the right of people to express their views and encourage actual conversations according to the [rules of reddit](https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

Thanks for working with us. Please keep the feedback coming.

– Jessica (/u/5days), Ellen (/u/ekjp), Alexis (/u/kn0thing) & the rest of team reddit

I'm Jill Stein and I'm running for president of the United States of America on the Green Party ticket. I plan to cancel student debt, provide head-to-toe healthcare to everyone, stop our expanding wars and end systemic racism. My Green New Deal will halt climate change while providing living-wage full employment by transitioning the United States to 100 percent clean, renewable energy by 2030. I'm a medical doctor, activist and mother on fire. Ask me anything!

 7:30 pm - Hi folks. Great talking with you. Thanks for your heartfelt concerns and questions. Remember your vote can make all the difference in getting a true people's party to the critical 5% threshold, where the Green Party receives federal funding and ballot status to effectively challenge the stranglehold of corporate power in the 2020 presidential election. 

Please go to jill2016.com or fb/twitter drjillstein for more. Also, tune in to my debate with Gary Johnson on Monday, Oct 31 and Tuesday, Nov 1 on Tavis Smiley on pbs. 

Reject the lesser evil and fight for the great good, like our lives depend on it. Because they do. 

Don't waste your vote on a failed two party system. Invest your vote in a real movement for change. 

We can create an America and a world that works for all of us, that puts people, planet and peace over profit.  The power to create that world is not in our hopes. It's not in our dreams. It's in our hands! 

Signing off till the next time. Peace up!

As such, beginning today r/baseball will temporarily be added as a default community to users in the US and Canada for the remainder of the fall classic, which is expected to end by early November at the latest.

What does being a default community entail, you ask? Defaults are the set of communities displayed on the front page of reddit to logged out users, as well as to logged in users who have never altered their subreddit subscriptions. This means posts from r/baseball will begin to appear on the front page for these users through the end of the World Series.

I regret to inform you that there is, in fact, [no crying in baseball](https://i.redd.it/gt2irz27xvrx.gif). However, we are aware that not everyone finds baseball to be the perfect combination of skill, athleticism, and statistical analysis. For those of you who do not wish to see r/baseball on their front page, simply visit the subreddit and click the “unsubscribe” button.

In an effort to continue moving forward, we are changing how we respond to legal takedowns. In 2014, the vast majority of the [content reddit removed was for copyright and trademark reasons](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014#wiki_requests_for_removal_of_user_information), and 2015 is shaping up to be no different.

Previously, when we removed content, we had to remove **everything**: link or self text, comments, all of it. When that happened, you might have come across a comments page that had nothing more than [this, surprised and censored Snoo](http://i.imgur.com/FSXEP66.png).

There would be no reason, no information, just a surprised, censored Snoo. Not even a ""discuss this on reddit,"" which is rather un-reddit-like.

Today, this changes. 

**Effective immediately,** we're replacing the use of censored Snoo and moving to an approach that lets us preserve content that hasn't specifically been legally removed (like comment threads), and clearly identifies that we, as reddit, INC, removed the content in question.

Let us pretend we have this post I made on reddit, suspiciously titled ""Test post, please ignore"", as seen [in its original state here](http://i.imgur.com/Fn5cQFu.png), featuring one of my cats. Additionally, there is a comment on that post which is the first paragraph of this post.

Should we receive a [valid DMCA request](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement#section_dmca) for this content and deem it legally actionable, rather than being greeted with censored Snoo and no other relevant information, visitors to the post instead will now see [a message stating that we, as admins of reddit.com, removed the content and a brief reason why](http://i.imgur.com/gcwz5ks.png). 

A more detailed, although still abridged, version of the notice will be posted to /r/ChillingEffects, and a sister post submitted to chillingeffects.org.

You can view an example of a removed post and comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChillingEffects/comments/35urvq/test_post_please_ignore/).

We hope these changes will provide more value to the community and provide as little interruption as possible when we receive these requests. We are committed to being as transparent as possible and empowering our users with more information.

Finally, as this is a relatively major change, we'll be posting a variation of this post to multiple subreddits. Apologies if you see this announcement in a couple different shapes and sizes.

Time to talk,14397,2fpdax,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2fpdax/time_to_talk/,8837,1410076177.0,"Alright folks, [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2foivo/every_man_is_responsible_for_his_own_soul/) has pretty obviously devolved and we're not getting anywhere. The blame for that definitely lies with us. We're trying to explain some of what has been going on here, but the simultaneous banning of that set of subreddits entangled in this situation has hurt our ability to have that conversation with you, the community. A lot of people are saying what we're doing here reeks of bullshit, and I don't blame them.


I'm not going to ask that you agree with me, but I hope that reading this will give you a better understanding of the decisions we've been poring over constantly over the past week, and perhaps give the community some deeper insight and understanding of what is happening here. I would ask, but obviously not require, that you read this fully and carefully before responding or voting on it. I'm going to give you the very raw breakdown of what has been going on at reddit, and it is likely to be coloured by my own personal opinions. All of us working on this over the past week are fucking exhausted, including myself, so you'll have to forgive me if this seems overly dour.


Also, as an aside, my main job at reddit is systems administration. I take care of the servers that run the site. It isn't my job to interact with the community, but I try to do what I can. I'm certainly not the best communicator, so please feel free to ask for clarification on anything that might be unclear.


With that said, here is what has been happening at reddit, inc over the past week.


A very shitty thing happened this past Sunday. A number of very private and personal photos were stolen and spread across the internet. The fact that these photos belonged to celebrities increased the interest in them by orders of magnitude, but that in no way means they were any less harmful or deplorable. If the same thing had happened to anyone you hold dear, it'd make you sick to your stomach with grief and anger.


When the photos went out, they inevitably got linked to on reddit. As more people became aware of them, we started getting a huge amount of traffic, which broke the site in several ways.


That same afternoon, we held an internal emergency meeting to figure out what we were going to do about this situation. Things were going pretty crazy in the moment, with many folks out for the weekend, and the site struggling to stay afloat. We had some immediate issues we had to address. First, the amount of traffic hitting this content was breaking the site in various ways. Second, we were already getting DMCA and takedown notices by the owners of these photos. Third, if we were to remove anything on the site, whether it be for technical, legal, or ethical obligations, it would likely result in a backlash where things kept getting posted over and over again, thwarting our efforts and possibly making the situation worse.


The decisions which we made amidst the chaos on Sunday afternoon were the following: I would do what I could, including disabling functionality on the site, to keep things running (this was a pretty obvious one). We would handle the DMCA requests as they came in, and recommend that the rights holders contact the company hosting these images so that they could be removed. We would also continue to monitor the site to see where the activity was unfolding, especially in regards to /r/all (we didn't want /r/all to be primarily covered with links to stolen nudes, deal with it). I'm not saying all of these decisions were correct, or morally defensible, but it's what we did based on our best judgement in the moment, and our experience with similar incidents in the past.


In the following hours, a lot happened. I had to break /r/thefappening a few times to keep the site from completely falling over, which as expected resulted in an immediate creation of a new slew of subreddits. Articles in the press were flying out and we were getting comment requests left and right. Many community members were understandably angered at our lack of action or response, and made that known in various ways. 

Later that day we were alerted that some of these photos depicted minors, which is where we have drawn a clear line in the sand. In response we immediately started removing things on reddit which we found to be linking to those pictures, and also recommended that the image hosts be contacted so they could be removed more permanently. We do not allow links on reddit to child pornography or images which sexualize children. If you disagree with that stance, and believe reddit cannot draw that line while also being a platform, I'd encourage you to leave.

This nightmare of the weekend made myself and many of my coworkers feel pretty awful. I had an obvious responsibility to keep the site up and running, but seeing that all of my efforts were due to a huge number of people scrambling to look at stolen private photos didn't sit well with me personally, to say the least. We hit new traffic milestones, ones which I'd be ashamed to share publicly. Our general stance on this stuff is that reddit is a platform, and there are times when platforms get used for very deplorable things. We take down things we're legally required to take down, and do our best to keep the site getting from spammed or manipulated, and beyond that we *try* to keep our hands off. Still, in the moment, seeing what we were seeing happen, it was hard to see much merit to that viewpoint.


As the week went on, press stories went out and debate flared everywhere. A lot of focus was obviously put on us, since reddit was clearly one of the major places people were using to find these photos. We continued to receive DMCA takedowns as these images were constantly rehosted and linked to on reddit, and in response we continued to remove what we were legally obligated to, and beyond that instructed the rights holders on how to contact image hosts. 

Meanwhile, we were having a huge amount of debate internally at reddit, inc. A lot of members on our team could not understand what we were doing here, why we were continuing to allow ourselves to be party to this flagrant violation of privacy, why we hadn't made a statement regarding what was going on, and how on earth we got to this point. It was messy, and continues to be. The pseudo-result of all of this debate and argument has been that we should continue to be as open as a platform as we can be, and that while we in no way condone or agree with this activity, we should not intervene beyond what the law requires. The arguments for and against are numerous, and this is not a comfortable stance to take in this situation, but it is what we have decided on.



That brings us to today. After painfully arriving at a stance internally, we felt it necessary to make a statement on the reddit blog. We could have let this die down in silence, as it was already tending to do, but we felt it was critical that we have this conversation with our community. If you haven't read it yet, **[please do so](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html)**.

So, we posted the message in the blog, and then we obliviously did something which heavily confused that message: We banned /r/thefappening and related subreddits. The confusion which was generated in the community was obvious, immediate, and massive, and we even had internal team members surprised by the combination. Why are we sending out a message about how we're being open as a platform, and not changing our stance, and then immediately banning the subreddits involved in this mess?


The answer is probably not satisfying, but it's the truth, and the only answer we've got. The situation we had in our hands was the following:  These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occurring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the [site rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It's obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.

---

Now, after all of the context from above, I'd like to respond to some of the common questions and concerns which folks are raising. To be extremely frank, I find *some* of the lines of reasoning that have generated these questions to be batshit insane. Still, in the vacuum of information which we have created, I recognize that we have given rise to much of this strife. As such I'll try to answer even the things which I find to be the most off-the-wall.

Q: You're only doing this in response to pressure from the public/press/celebrities/Conde/Advance/other!

A: The press and nature of this incident obviously made this issue extremely public, but it was not the reason why we did what we did. If you read all of the above, hopefully you can be recognize that the actions we have taken were our own, for our own internal reasons. I can't force anyone to believe this of course, you'll simply have to decide what you believe to be the truth based on the information available to you.


Q: Why aren't you banning these other subreddits which contain deplorable content?!

A: We remove what we're required to remove by law, and what violates any [rules](http://www.reddit.com) which we have set forth. Beyond that, we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible, and to let the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them. I believe the [blog post](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html) speaks very well to this.

We have banned /r/TheFappening and related subreddits, for reasons I outlined above.



Q: You're doing this because of the IAmA app launch to please celebs!

A: No, I can say absolutely and clearly that the IAmA app had zero bearing on our course of decisions regarding this event. I'm sure it is exciting and intriguing to think that there is some clandestine connection, but it's just not there.


Q: Are you planning on taking down all copyrighted material across the site?

A: We take down what we're required to by law, which may include thumbnails, in response to valid DMCA takedown requests. Beyond that we tell claimants to contact whatever host is actually serving content. This policy will not be changing.



Q: You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits! Give it back / Give it to charity!

A: This is a tricky issue, one which we haven't figured out yet and that I'd welcome input on. Gold was purchased by our users, to give to other users. Redirecting their funds to a random charity which the original payer may not support is not something we're going to do. We also do not feel that it is right for us to decide that certain things should not receive gold. The user purchasing it decides that. We don't hold this stance because we're money hungry (the amount of money in question is small).




That's all I have. Please forgive any confusing bits above, it's very late and I've written this in urgency. I'll be around for as long as I can to answer questions in the comments.

Let's talk content. AMA.,14097,3djjxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/,21631,1437076815.0,"We started Reddit to be—as we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks—“The front page of the Internet.” Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: “because I don’t want that content on our site.”

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn’t have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we’re careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit—or at least say on our public pages—in the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone’s private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say ""I don't like this group of people."" It's not ok to say, ""I'm going to kill this group of people."")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don’t pollute people’s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor’s listings, and we think it’ll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We’ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don’t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it’s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I’d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this ""Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.""

edit: added an example to clarify our concept of ""harm""
edit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy

We are the WikiLeaks staff. Despite our editor Julian Assange's increasingly precarious situation WikiLeaks continues publishing,28895,5c8u9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/,14648,1478796488.0,"EDIT: Thanks guys that was great. We need to get back to work now, but thank you for joining us. 

You can follow for any updates on Julian Assange's case at his [legal defence website](https://justice4assange.com/) and support his defence [here](https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/45DZ1). You can suport WikiLeaks, which is tax deductible in Europe and the United States, [here](https://shop.wikileaks.org/donate).

And keep reading and researching the documents!

We are the [WikiLeaks](https://wikileaks.org/) staff, including [Sarah Harrison](http://www.vogue.com/11122973/sarah-harrison-edward-snowden-wikileaks-nsa/). Over the last months we have published over 25,000 [emails from the DNC](https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/), over 30,000 [emails from Hillary Clinton](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/), over 50,000 [emails from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/) and many chapters of the secret controversial [Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA)](https://wikileaks.org/tisa/).

The Clinton campaign unsuccessfully tried to claim that our publications are inaccurate. WikiLeaks’ decade-long pristine record for authentication remains. [As Julian said](https://wikileaks.org/Assange-Statement-on-the-US-Election.html): ""Our key publications this round have even been proven through the [cryptographic signatures](https://www.wikileaks.org/DKIM-Verification.html) of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them.""

We have been very excited to see all the great citizen journalism taking place [here at Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/) on these publications, especially on the [DNC email archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/DNCleaks/) and the [Podesta emails](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5a3x7l/wikileaks_central_station_on_rthe_donald/?st=ivcib4ow&sh=895ef2e0).

Recently, the White House, in an effort to silence its most critical publisher during an election period, pressured for our editor Julian Assange's publications to be stopped. The government of Ecuador then issued a statement saying that it had ""temporarily"" [severed Mr. Assange's internet link over the US election](http://www.cancilleria.gob.ec/en/official-communique_2/). As of the 10th his internet connection has not been restored. There has been no explanation, which is concerning.

WikiLeaks has the necessary contingency plans in place to keep publishing. WikiLeaks staff, continue to monitor the situation closely.

In my opinion, the largest subreddit--/r/pics/--is moderated insufficiently, and with policies that are either insufficient, or not enforced. Personally, I don't feel safe opening links there when I am browsing in public, due to the lax stance on NSFW content. I also constantly wish that my reports meant something, and that policies were enforced. For the amount of people who view links there, I really feel like it has gotten out of hand, and this is an experiment to see if anyone is interested in a more controlled and logical approach to organization, discussion, and civility. My policy on similar-subreddits will help keep this place have fresh interesting content, and it will also help grow and populate smaller subreddits who are larger than my 2K threshold. I honestly believe this experiment could revolutionize reddit, by focussing on categorization and policies, and it will also help wonderful communities here grow. 

*****

These are the rules that would be used by the subreddit if I became moderator:

* Derivative posts should be kept within the comments of the original post. If the post is simply derivative of another post and belongs in the comments of that post rather than on it's own post, it will be removed.

* Copycat titles will not be tolerated. 

* This is a SFW subreddit. Content deemed NSFW by moderators or users will not be tolerated, even if labelled.

* Vague titles will generally not be tolerated. Titles are a descriptive heading that helps recognize a link, identify the contents of a link, recognize a repost, and greatly help users find the post again using search.

* Direct image links are preferred (if the original source of an image can't be found), as links to webpages can be deemed as 'blogspam'. Tineye.com can help you find the original source of an image, or larger resolutions.  Watermarks are allowed, as long as they are not large, and do not take away from the image.

* Links which are deemed as far too relevant to a particular subreddit with over 2K subscribers will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to /politics, /gifs, /worldnews, and /photocritique. A list of related subreddits will be created in the sidebar.

* Self-posts will generally not be tolerated. Text-only images will not be tolerated. 

* Spam will not be tolerated.

Violations of these policies in the sidebar will result in your submission being removed from the listings, which you may attempt to appeal by messaging the moderators. Multiple abuses may result in a ban from the subreddit. These will be warned ahead of time, and avoided where possible.

Moderators:

* No moderator is permitted to moderate any subreddits with a larger number of subscribers. This policy is to keep moderators fresh-blooded, uncontroversial, and focussed on their responsibilities.

* Moderators are required to message a user the specific reason if they are banned from the subreddit.

* Moderators will be sworn in with a boilerplate comment that promises the users they will act according to their responsibilities, or face the consequence of removal. Nominations will occasionally be made to acquire a new moderator. No more than 10 moderators will ever coexist (subject to change at 100K subscribers).

Users:

* When you report a submission, if the reason is not extremely obvious, please make a comment that describes the issue. 

* Your participation is valuable. Please submit, vote, and comment. Please follow rediquette.

Policies will be linked from the sidebar, and a large effort will be made to notify you if any of the policies change.

The stylesheet of this subreddit may change.

Feel free to leave questions or comments below. This post will not be edited unless explicitly noted in an 'edit' below.

Edit1: point 5 was edited to express preferability to original sources of images, as per `nebopolis`'s suggestion below

Edit2: `Band_B` pointed out ambiguity in what I meant by 'ban'. That part has been revised.

Edit3: `raldi` has suggested that I replace the word 'ban' with 'remove from the listings' to clear up the ambiguity.

Edit4: `raldi` has notified me that a submission should not be reported if a comment has been reported, due to the way they factor into the spam filter.

Edit5: `CrasyMike` has suggested that instead of a 7 day period limit for derivative posts, I should use a judgement-call type of policy. It has been replaced above.

Edit6: Thank you for your support. Hueypriest has instated me as a moderator. I will try my best to keep this place sane. When my goals are reached and this subreddit is in a stable state according to my vision, I will remove myself as moderator.

Again, thank you.",top_subreddit,1,2011-01-13 00:41:42

Schizophrenic Musings on Solipsism,3,aqk56d,https://www.reddit.com/r/original/comments/aqk56d/schizophrenic_musings_on_solipsism/,0,1550153515.0,"When your brain is littered with a record of delusions and false memories, one of your central life questions is whether you create reality or are merely a fool. I've long sought to resolve this question because, frankly, I'd far rather be a mere fool than creator of the sorts of horrors that psychosis has forever put into my head by means of my subjectivity. That question devolves on solipsism. Fundamentally, either the world I experience is my creature, or I'm the speckiest of specks of dust in it. The elaborate reasoning needed to establish that assertion philosophically is fairly old hat and not worth repeating in a Reddit post.

I've tried to draw comfort from the very occasional reality of being surprised. My contact with other peope has been slightest of slightness in a largely isolated fantasy life, but from time to time another person will say something that makes me go ""Hmm."" Those moments, which I've heard the caregivers of people with autism describe observationally as finally losing their patience and shouting the obvious at the person they care for, with surprisingly high effectiveness, have from my side felt like epiphanies when another human being in the guise of a deity has said something that had entirely eluded me. The competitive deceitfulness and secretiveness of people has made those moments extremely few in my life, but in retrospect I treasure all of them. And getting back to what I was even saying in the first place in this paragraph, those moments feel like definitive counterexamples that I am entirely the creator of my own experience, but rather that There Are Others. Tying that in with what's long-established by credible thinkers about creation of one's own experience either being absolute or nonexistent, I can logically conclude that I don't create a damned thing. It all comes to me  by means of other agencies, and I am either a product or a happenstance and no more than that.

Yet a speck, being infinitesimal, can consist only of the assertion that it Is. That stands in absolute contradiction to its reality as product or happenstance. For that reason I've never succeeded in being comforted by surprises for particularly long. For the most part, I've rapidly reverted to that infinitesimal point of assertion, which is to say of  Being, without which, well, d'oh, I wouldn't Be at all. So back I always go to the inner pressure to be solipsistic and give credence to stupidities about the world that are demonstrably false, and which make me abject and wretched about what never happened and what no one did, least of all me. It's a fight no human being can possibly win, because it's part of the irresolvable stalemate of The War of Self Against Self, which is lifelong and during which there can be no stable, enduring ceasefires. Or maybe that's just having schizophrenia. How am I even supposed to know?

    These Beasts were all dead.
    
    The cavern was dim, but Peshishtu's vision had adjusted quickly. Survival does that to you.
    
    Survival also gradually robs you of your mind. You can find food anywhere, turn any trash and ruin into a tool or accessory, but you can't think about it. So Peshistu gazed and the huge, sprawling forms, thrown over each other amidst shattered furniture and decoratives, and saw only scavenge.
    
    The most important person of her generation started her ascent by pawing through limbs and ruin for what she could use to stay alive a little longer. She may have been fourteen, but maybe sixteen, or maybe twelve. Gaunt from the ruination left behind by The Shaking of the Earth all too recently, her hair uncut and matted and tangled because washing it wasn't even a thought. Soft prosperity grooms itself. Hard survival looks for food sources.

Peshishtu growled deep in her lungs at not finding anything. Then, as if in response, she glimpsed something that to her meant “cut.” She picked up the foot-long sticklike thing and her sharpened vision saw its long-sharp edge. She smiled so broadly that she leered at this thing of the Beasts that had been sharp since before her birth and would stay sharp long after her death. All she'd have to do is find a way to carry it, avoid losing it, and use it.

    That leer was the birth of her smile. In time she would be a beauty because of it. But what is the trigger of greatness? *Rlishishemarlashashtesh!* *What does greatness even look like?* ",top_subreddit,1,2019-03-05 13:06:32
Yarks,2,as8h70,https://www.reddit.com/r/original/comments/as8h70/yarks/,0,1550567582.0,"	In the Twenty-Second Century, the world has a big problem with yarks.

	Nobody remembers what the acronym “IARC” meant when it was first coined, but people know far more than they want to about the tiny minority of humans it describes. Yarks are the materialist-atheist immortals: they regenerate. I mean, how else are you going to define immortality if you’re a materialist atheist? Makes total sense.

	The problem with yarks is that anybody who lives for more than about six generations or 120 years, which is the maximum lifespan for normal human tissues, becomes such an incredible butthole that they’re impossible to get along with. Since you can’t kill yarks, you have to figure out what else to do with them—and other solutions that have been attempted have been disastrous.

	Simply confining a yark with no thought to his experience of confinement gives you the Ancient Greek Gods all over again. Those had been yarks whom exasperated Ancients had simply buried in loose soil. The explanation for those yarks acquiring divine-seeming powers is very technical, but it has to do with regeneration adjusting to the environment. It’s why the sarcophagi of some Egyptian mummies will never be opened. Yeech! … Don’t think too much about it, as it gets even weirder than that.

Anyway, those immured yarks created Mount Olympos as a dining room with no exits and with just enough room for a table, just enough chairs, and Zeus’s dais. Try putting a bunch of deranged crazies together in a sealed dining room with nothing to do until the end of time except chat pleasantly because that’s all they have! Since nobody wants the Twenty-Second-Century equivalent of Sisyphus to be a real guy in a real place on Earth, or for the Twenty-Second-Century equivalent of Medusa to be a real monster somewhere real on earth for lost travelers to blunder into the lair of, or for the Twenty-Second-Century equivalent of hades to be some real shitty place under the real earth where real dead souls go, this idea of simply locking the yarks up in the Bastille is right out. 

(Oh, yeah, the Bastille was thought to be a better solution for yarks than burying them alive, until the 18 yarks in the Bastille gave us, first, the awful behavior of the late-monarchic French aristocracy, and then that guillotining festival that followed the French Revolution. A renaissance of the Bastille for yarks is right out.)

What has to be found is some way to make sure the yarks aren’t harming real people while at the same time they aren’t so tormented that they acquire divine-seeming powers. Part of the solution that is being attempted in the fabulously technologically advanced Twenty-Second-Century is a type of holodeck where features come into existence when the yark first has an opportunity to sense them. What’s around the corner of a hallway doesn’t even exist until the yark gets to the corner and sees what’s around the corner; and, when he sees it, it comes into existence. There are so many potential features in this holodeck’s databanks that the chance of a Yark ever finding an exit, or encountering another yark, are zero, yet the yark will never get bored of the same old walls and the same old doors and rooms.

But that’s not enough. Since the yark is going to be alone until the universe reaches heat death, there has to be stuff for him to do that he can do alone that keeps him sufficiently occupied for that long. Well, yarks are a heirloomy bunch, as can be expected given their ridiculous ages. Some were around back when the land in Texas was still part of Mexico. Just use the fabulous fiction-writing software of the Twenty-Second-Century to have heirlooms pop up as needed and have the yarks cheerfully prowling around figuring out what the stories behind the heirlooms are.

But wait a minute. You’re not a yark. What are you even doing in there?

Oh, crap. Well, don’t panic. We’ll help get you out. Follow the storylines. And if the current storyline bores you, go find a different heirloom to start a new one. We’re tweaking things to get you too the exit, but we have to handle the yarks at the same time, so we can’t be completely direct and obvious about it. It’s just not possible. And one thing that’s super not possible is having anything exist until you have a chance to sense it. Don’t waste time wondering what’s beyond that door you just encountered. There won’t be anything until you open the door, and then there will be whatever we can safely put there to help you toward the exit. It will be far from perfect, but we really do want to help. You mean a lot to us.

Oh, and avoid the yarks at all costs. If there’s the slightest chance you’ll encounter one, make damned sure you don’t. Regeneration adjusts to the environment. Don’t try to find out what that even means. You don’t want to. And we’ll help you make sure that you don’t.

Good luck to you. No matter who wins the office pool on you making it out alive, we’ll make sure they give you half the money.

&#x200B;

	Whoever wrote that is obviously crazy. Or whatever wrote that. There are no “yarks.” There’s only some sick mind playing sick games with the player character. And the real objective of the game is to find out what’s “really” going on and thwart it. That way lies true freedom.

	The real game engine can pseudorandomly select from a pool of rooms with the configuration of rooms refreshed for each game. With a pool of 300 rooms there are 44,850! (factorial) possible different games ranging in size from a maximum of 300 rooms to a minimum of one. That’s a very large number of potentially different gameplays, with the vast majority having some significant uniqueness, or several significant uniquenesses. The key is to be broad-minded about what “room” means. A room can be anything from a staircase to a city street to a forest to a lake. Yes, it’s a huge amount of data, but the standards and practices of game design already have mechanisms in place for databasing a large variety of registers. The game art would be the real bulk of storage, which is why a cloud-based deployment should be considered.

I personally favour the old turn-based games, but a real-time game is feasible. A graphically rich text game could also be entertaining for the player and easier to implement on mobile devices. In a text-based game the art would be everything and would require enough of a budget to retain competent graphic artists, but the engine itself would be nearly trivial to code.

The storylines for the clues would have to be modular, and that’s where the game design would do its heavy lifting. Modular fiction with many branches is very, very difficult to pull off because of the nature of storytelling. That would require some forethought and a team of talented writers.

The simplest approach might be to have the player’s mind fill in the details of any apparent inconsistencies. If the character is walking along the shore in the wilderness and encounters a large boulder, that boulder can variously be an obstacle to circumvent, a token of the deep geological past, quarrying material, a potential sculpture of a large animal for the character to chisel, a memory of the player having met the love of their life at such a boulder, and almost anything else within human experience. From the viewpoint of game engine it would still be just that same rock. The language of the description would have to be suggestive enough to have the player’s mind supply all of the necessary details to make the character encountering that boulder a rich experience.

Therefore:

&#x200B;

Exercise for the Game Design Team:

Have your graphic artist draw a basic sketch of a boulder at the edge of a body of water.

The whole team brainstorm a list of how a player’s mind might interpret their character encountering that stone while walking along the edge of the body of water.

The graphic artists and writing teams work together to add both graphical and linguistic detail that will be differently suggestive to different players based on the players’ experiences over the course of the players’ lives.

The coders code an appropriate way to present that boulder graphic and the text within the context of a game the player is playing with their current character.",top_subreddit,1,2019-02-19 03:13:02

The Epitaph of Hillario Ponderosa,2,ahaamg,https://www.reddit.com/r/original/comments/ahaamg/the_epitaph_of_hillario_ponderosa/,0,1547817076.0,"Prendergast adjusted Hillario's head with subtle pressure from her fingertips. Although an unimaginable brute, each of whose breasts was larger than the head she was adjusting, Prendergast had the fingertip touch of a surgeon.

Hillario knew that that wouldn't keep his head still enough for the Printer. After six generations of life, his tremors were unavoidable. But stillness was down to the Trust between the levels of recursion of Reality; the Trust that is Life.

So Hillario Trusted, and heard the loud \_snack\_ as the Printer captured his retinae. Already Prendergast was at the Printer, those fine hands the size of hams running the fanfold between their fingers as it emerged from between the drum and the platen, crammed with a long lifetime of memories.

Hillario had already made peace with having been no more than a data storage device, like the ""flash drives"" from his grandfather's childhood. Everything he had felt truly mattered, all those lived experiences that had devoured his fragile heart, had been mere distractions to prevent him from corrupting the data he'd been storing until it could be retrieved. That much was fine. He was finally ready to let go, to cease the deathless struggle to live that always ended in death.

Then he noticed that Prendergast wasn't a woman any longer. She, or rather it, was a machine on wheels.

The levels had betrayed him once again. It was the nature of Trust to be betrayed. And he felt himself slipping away with too little time to puzzle out what this level of Reality was.

""Thank you for your memories,"" said Prendergast in a voice like the frying of flux on trillions of solder joints. That voice reminded him of something from a museum, an old relic of his grandfather's days. That thing had had a name. \_What had been its name????\_

It was no good. He was slipping away too quickly to recall. He began to make peace with never having known anything.

Then, in the last infinitesimal moment of his life, the name began to come to him.

\_Alex...\_

And then half of an ""a.""

The other half would never be.

The Architect : 

Ch1 - Frustration

Along the coast in the Gulf of Alaska, was a prison surrounded by towering gates, watch towers, and barbed wire. Sentinels patrolled every entrance and exit.   
This prison contained America's most vile criminals. A man named Vincent Maine was among them.   
John Hudson, the director of the Quartz agency, stationed in the deserts of Nevada, was a well-to-do spy who captured said vile criminals. 

John arrived to the prison by a helicopter to pay Vincent a visit. At the front entrance a guard greeted him nearby.

""Hello sir. Right this way,"" she said and led him inside.

Vincent was lying on a small bed in his containment room. The room was all white, lit with fluorescent lights. A large glass window presented the other side of the room, which was just a door, and a member of the prison staff would occasionally walk by and peep in. Vincent was expecting John to walk through that door.

He contemplated his failed attempt to save America from itself. He lost his daughter and a number of people who stood by him in the process. Now, he was a man with a death sentence. He was to be executed by morning. The reason why - Vincent was responsible for murdering a great number of America's political figures.

The door opened. Just then, John, his former best friend walked into the containment room while accompanied by a guard. Vincent closed his eyes and a sly smile played on his lips.

""All of this, and for what?"" John began with vexation in his tone. ""After everything we've been through, what were you trying to prove?"" He was enraged, confused and heartbroken all at the same time.

Vincent stayed silent and still. 

Then John shouted furiously, ""Aaron was just a kid!!!"" And his voice echoed.

Vincent unclosed his eyes and sat up on the edge of his bed. He looked John in the eyes with a deadpan expression, and John raised his eyebrows expectantly. Vincent couldn't care less about anyone or anything at the moment.

""Do you seriously think that I care?"" He asked. ""Because I don't.""

John's fingers went deeper into his palms as his eyes began to glisten with tears. 

Then Vincent straightened up and took a breath.  ""All you had to do was listen. But no...you just wanted to *save* the day. I know you all meant well, but I was trying to do the actual saving. I was saving you all from yourselves. But you were too blind and stubborn to see it. *I* was trying to make everything greater. Greater for everyone. A lot of good people died because of you...you're the one that got Aaron killed, John.""

That's when John snapped. He went inside the containment room, charging at Vincent.

In an instant, John had Vincent on the floor, giving him repeated heavy blows to the face. The guard tried to stop him, but it only earned her a nasty right hook.   
As John continued to beat his fist into Vincent's face, Vincent couldn't help but laugh maniacally. The harder he laughed, the harder John beat him. John wanted Vincent to understand his pain, although he low-key knew it was no use. All the frustration lingered within John. If he killed Vincent, he would still feel upset. 

It wasn't long before John's hands were painted crimson red with blood. He wasn't sure if it was his or Vincent's. He wasn't too sure if he had killed Vincent after the beating he gave him.  
Guards rushed in on the scene and found Vincent's unconscious body on the floor. He was awfully bloody and bruised. He had a plump bottom lip and both of his eyes were swollen shut. The guards didn't know what to do.  
John sat in a corner crying huge tears, and there was the guard with a bloody nose who endured John's nasty right hook, lying on the floor.

""Dear, God,"" one guard whispered.

The meaning of PAIN,1,avu45j,https://www.reddit.com/r/original/comments/avu45j/the_meaning_of_pain/,0,1551377056.0,"This is just a snippet that reflects my thinking aloud of the physical meaning of 'SELF' and how it helped me overcome physical pain. To give a background about myself (so the context is clear), I am from India with some exposure to western culture (that is, experiencing culture in the West) and slipping into the middle of middle-age. I am also a business man, more so an entrepreneur. A mildly successful one, at that. So, my thoughts are influenced by Indian culture & people, and I am not sure if this is felt relevant either in the West, East or the Middle-east.

&#x200B;

It is clear that I sense the world through my senses of touch, smell, sight, taste and hearing (thankfully, all of them). Just taking 'alone-time' and thinking through what constitutes me gives a feeling that there is this body that is being controlled by my mind (or more accurately, my brain), but I do not feel these two are different aspects of a being. Clearly, I feel one cannot exist without the other. That feeling is so great and given that any effect on a part of my body or mind vastly affects the other and the concern as a whole is felt. Say, you stub your toe bad enough that it has gone blue. You feel the pain almost throughout your body, though you cannot pin point where. Your mind is very aware that it is best to keep your toe out of harms way in a very deliberate manner. A larger injury may make you sick, too. But, why does this happen? It is only a small part of your body at the end of your foot that is injured, possibly not even broken. The one obvious answer is that evolution helped us to be structured that way. But it makes no sense when we have become intelligent and aware that it is only a small part of the body that may be, most times, inconsequential. The mind clearly knows that.

&#x200B;

So, to test if the mind can be controlled, I waited for the right situation. I am allergic to wasp bites. And, when I got bitten in the hand (on my little finger, actually), the entire arm got swollen. In 48 hours the pain was hitting me through my wrist onto the ulna and I was finding it difficult to bend my elbow. The whole arm was on fire, or so it felt. The only relief I could get was to place the entire arm in a bucket of ice-cold water to cool it down. The relief was temporary. Perfect situation to try some mind games, I thought. During one of those sleepless nights, I was very keen to understand where the pain was emanating from. One place was clearly where I was stung. Other than that, I could not pinpoint the exact location of the rest of the pain. To my amazement, the harder I tried to pick the location of the pain in the arm, the lesser the pain seemed to be. I am not sure how long I was trying this, because the next thing I remember is to wake up in the morning, with the searing pain back in my arm. It took me sometime to gather my wits (and complete my ablutions) before I remembered what happened the previous night. So, I was back in a quiet place all by myself and was quite persistent to understand the location of the pain through my arm. That is when I knew this is something I need to share with people. The pain became so much more bearable. This led me to think of a hypothesis.

&#x200B;

Let us assume I am an able-bodied person with normal mental abilities (which I hope I am). If I were to trim the nails of my toe and fingers, would my mind think differently? I think not. I would still think I am the same person. In this hypothesis, I am not supposed to feel pain. Without sounding gruesome, let me cut off part of my leg up to my ankle (assume the cut leg heals instantly, with no pain or no bleeding and no 'Phantom limb' syndrome). Would I be the same person? I guess so. What if, I progressed this chopping spree upwards and get both my legs amputated at the hip. I should be the same person (possibly a lot shorter, I suppose). My mind would still think whatever is left of me is still me. I would still see the world through the same eyes and feel the same warmth around me. I should feel the same way when I proceed to remove my hands.

&#x200B;

Now let me proceed to replace each of my organs with artificial machines or external support systems. For example, my kidneys are replaced by external dialysis machines. My heart is replaced by a mechanical device powered externally, etc. Would I not feel to be the same person. It still is me. If we continue with this gruesome exercise, and I am left with just the head, with blood artificially energised and pumped into my brain, I would continue to feel I am still me, though I would also feel highly straight-jacketed! I guess, this is how people would have felt when they were guillotined in France. A severed head briefly looking helplessly at the body it got detached from, till it was overcome by a sense of unconsciousness.

&#x200B;

So, from this hypothesis I am presuming (because I could have got many things wrong here), that the sense of 'self' is really originating from the brain, a tactic it has used to ensure the body never gets separated from the 'Command Centre'. So, why does it need to do this? I haven't understood the connection between this tactic and the need to preserve the DNA. Because, ultimately, it seems all life has the preservation and propagation of the gene as the only purpose.

&#x200B;

One good thing that came out of this thought process is that I last suffered a headache more than 10 years ago. It now seems a simple solution to feel the headache and try and locate the origin of the pain. The pain seems to magically disappear. Of course, if I suffer an injury, I can quite easily feel the location of the pain. But, that pain is localised and very manageable, if you know what I mean.

&#x200B;

I am hoping this snippet helps people, especially those in perennial pain, alleviate the distress and increase their quality of life.

&#x200B;

A movie I really liked but forgot the title. Can anyone help?,1,ab4ger,https://www.reddit.com/r/original/comments/ab4ger/a_movie_i_really_liked_but_forgot_the_title_can/,0,1546236658.0,"I'll detail what the movie is about in bullet points (I suck in summarizing):

* Had this GTA kind of mod. There's the map like in GTA at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.
* Not cartoon-ish or graphical. Actual human was brought inside the game.
* The human character trapped had to kill this 18th century-like monster looking like between a female, red, long dress outfit-wearing frankenstein with a vampire-ish aura.

That's all I could remember. I would appreciate if anyone could find the answer for me. Merci beacoup!",top_subreddit,1,2018-12-31 00:10:58

Some of these tracks could easily have been hits back then, in my opinion. Or part of the Miami Vice soundtrack. :)

I thought it would be fun if we played through diablo together at my house. When we started we had to pick our classes (obviously) i chose witch doctor and he chose crusader, we started at about 4 in the afternoon and we played until 6 the following morning eating bags of chips and drinking bottles of coke to keep ourselves up and moving we got through about 3/4 through the main campaign (i had the dlc so we were pumped for that) i think we were like level 25-30 we had developed a loot system and formulated our trips into town around our bathroom breaks basically but when we finally finished playing for that night we agreed that we had to finish the game (+dlc of course) and after a few months we dusted off our characters like we were meeting old friends and proceeded to finish what we started. We beat the main game pretty quickly so we moved onto the dlc. 

We trudged through the dlc like the soldiers of no-mans-land we slowly made it through and faced out ultimate foe... MALPAEL! The angel of death the final hurdle between us and completion we fought and fought until we took him down i even swapped characters to try and best him with Dazza but I eventually played with my witch doctor and beat him. We felt such a feeling of pride and accomplishment because WE had done it! Despite the odds stacked against us we beat the game.

Thanks for reading this far i know many might not see this as nostalgia but I thought it was worth putting out there maybe people who played games like halo 3 and left 4 dead with their friends could relate and my story could resonate with them.

Last Best Decade in the US,0,4kecvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/4kecvq/last_best_decade_in_the_us/,3,1463849380.0,"The 90s were the last best decade for the USA. Kids were kids and played outside. No one was afraid of each other and parents let kids play with other kids without worry besides if they came home with a wound. Everyone was thick skinned still and could take a insult instead of being a sissy and crying about it for weeks. 90s kids had the best quality of cartoons that related to them and helped kids in those same situations. (hey Arnold) it was also the time before everything became heavily regulated on what could and couldn't be shown on tv. Not only was the economy booming in the 90s but so was society and also technology. When 9/11 happened it was basically a nail on the coffin ending the greatness the 90s built up to. Everything started to be regulated and toned down to make sure kids weren't physically or psychologically scarred from TV shows and people were afraid of each other because of terrorists. Everything started to become much more complicated than it needs to be after 9/11 and the economy took a massive dive and when the economy takes a dive, so is society.",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-05-21 11:49:40

I feel nostalgic whenever I see or listen to something associated to the 80s sometimes it makes me sad as well.",1,9wckku,https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/9wckku/i_was_born_in_1997_yet_i_shouldve_been_born_in/,33,1542014462.0,"Hey, just your common young teen here. 

If you fully read the title then you understand how much I love this decade. 

I dress like in the 80s. I exclusively listen to 1980s music and 80s remixes (today’s songs turned into 80s songs) and sometimes early 1990s music. I have the mentality of 3 decades ago. I love 80s cars. 80s movies are the best as well, etc... Basically I like everything from that time.

Now the problem is: there’s no way to truly experience it, it’s simply impossible it’s gone, forever..

I loathe the 21st century, its trends, the society’s mentality, I hate millennials and gen Z with a burning passion, 9/11 ruined a lot of things, terrorism and shootings everywhere, the music is beyond garbage, nightclubs are just pathetic, dating and love is a joke too.

People who were teens in the 80s consider me as a mere child with no experience whatsoever, they think I don’t know anything nor I belong to their generation. I’m basically a 50 year old stuck in a teenage body while missing out on childhood and adolescence. I don’t belong to any generation apparently, oh well nevermind it’s fine.

I would literally give ANYTHING to be able to make a trip to 1984 and live through the most amazing times of all. I would also get to experience big historical events such as the fall of the Iron Curtain, 1984 Olympics, tearing down the Berlin Wall etc etc... 

It would be my biggest dream, to be an 80s teen, find my love there and perhaps even have a wedding in those days. I’ve always pictured myself in an high school dance in ‘85 kissing my girlfriend and later wife during an emotional power ballad, tears of joy in our eyes, playing that same song on our wedding day too... (Search on YouTube: Moonlight - Ariana Grande 1980s remix. not an 80s song per se but still as emotional and strong as an authentic song)

I’m nostalgic for a time I’ve never been.


Thank you.
