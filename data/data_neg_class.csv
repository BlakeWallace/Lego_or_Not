An old team at reddit,132253,3cucye,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/,20402,1436562890.0,"Ellen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement.  I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.
 
We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.
 
We’re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of “cofounder”.
 
A few other points.  Mods, you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.
 
Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.

Third, as a redditor, I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.
 
As a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.

If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.
 
 
[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.

Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.
 
[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate—he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.


NOTE: I am going to let the reddit team answer questions here, and go do an AMA myself now.

An Open Letter to the Reddit Community,115852,5r43td,https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/5r43td/an_open_letter_to_the_reddit_community/,31034,1485815689.0,"After two weeks abroad, I was looking forward to returning to the U.S. this weekend, but as I got off the plane at LAX on Sunday, I wasn't sure what country I was coming back to.

President Trump’s recent executive order is not only potentially unconstitutional, but deeply un-American. We are a nation of immigrants, after all. In the tech world, we often talk about a startup’s “unfair advantage” that allows it to beat competitors. Welcoming immigrants and refugees has been our country's unfair advantage, and coming from an immigrant family has been mine as an entrepreneur.

As many of you know, I am the son of an undocumented immigrant from Germany and the great grandson of refugees who fled the Armenian Genocide.

A little over a century ago, a Turkish soldier decided my great grandfather was too young to kill after cutting down his parents in front of him; instead of turning the sword on the boy, the soldier sent him to an orphanage. Many Armenians, including my great grandmother, found sanctuary in Aleppo, Syria—before the two reconnected and found their way to Ellis Island. Thankfully they weren't retained, rather they found this message:

*“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”*

My great grandfather didn’t speak much English, but he worked hard, and was able to get a job at Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company in Binghamton, NY. That was his family's golden door. And though he and my great grandmother had four children, all born in the U.S., immigration continued to reshape their family, generation after generation. The one son they had—my grandfather [(here’s his AMA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29039l/iam_john_ohanian_92_year_old_lawyer_parttime/)—volunteered to serve in the Second World War and married a French-Armenian immigrant. And my mother, a native of Hamburg, Germany, decided to leave her friends, family, and education behind after falling in love with my father, who was born in San Francisco.

She got a student visa, came to the U.S. and then worked as an au pair, uprooting her entire life for love in a foreign land. She overstayed her visa. She should have left, but she didn't. After she and my father married, she received a green card, which she kept for over a decade until she became a citizen. I grew up speaking German, but she insisted I focus on my English in order to be successful. She eventually got her citizenship and I’ll never forget her swearing in ceremony.

If you’ve never seen people taking the pledge of allegiance for the first time as U.S. Citizens, it will move you: a room full of people who can really appreciate what I was lucky enough to grow up with, simply by being born in Brooklyn. It thrills me to write reference letters for enterprising founders who are looking to get visas to start their companies here, to create value and jobs for these United States.

My forebears were brave refugees who found a home in this country. I’ve always been proud to live in a country that said yes to these shell-shocked immigrants from a strange land, that created a path for a woman who wanted only to work hard and start a family here. 

Without them, there’s no me, and there’s no Reddit. We are Americans. Let’s not forget that we’ve thrived as a nation because we’ve been a beacon for the courageous—the tired, the poor, the tempest-tossed.

Right now, Lady Liberty’s lamp is dimming, which is why it's more important than ever that we speak out and show up to support all those for whom it shines—past, present, and future. I ask you to do this however you see fit, whether it's calling your representative (this works, it's how we defeated SOPA + PIPA), marching in protest, [donating to the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu), or voting, of course, and not just for Presidential elections.

Our platform, like our country, thrives the more people and communities we have within it. Reddit, Inc. will continue to welcome all citizens of the world to our digital community and our office.

—Alexis

The letter acknowledges that AI might one day help eradicate disease and poverty, but it also puts the onus on scientists at the forefront of this technology to keep the human factor front and center of their innovations. I'm part of a campaign enabled by Nokia and hope you will join the conversation on http://www.wired.com/maketechhuman. Learn more about my foundation here: http://stephenhawkingfoundation.org/ 
 

Due to the fact that I will be answering questions at my own pace, working with the moderators of /r/Science we are opening this thread up in advance to gather your questions. 
 

My goal will be to answer as many of the questions you submit as possible over the coming weeks. I appreciate all of your understanding, and taking the time to ask me your questions.


**Moderator Note**

This AMA will be run differently due to the constraints of Professor Hawking.  The AMA will be in two parts, today we with gather questions.  Please post your questions and vote on your favorite questions, from these questions Professor Hawking will select which ones he feels he can give answers to.  

Once the answers have been written, we, the mods, will cut and paste the answers into this AMA and post a link to the AMA in /r/science so that people can re-visit the AMA and read his answers in the proper context.  The date for this is undecided, as it depends on several factors.  

Professor Hawking is a guest of /r/science and has volunteered to answer questions; please treat him with due respect. **Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.**

"We need to make it clear to the FCC that we want uncapped Internet access, for innovation in an increasingly data dependent world and user protection.",71430,5749a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5749a8/we_need_to_make_it_clear_to_the_fcc_that_we_want/,2459,1476281600.0,"Comcast's data cap policy is a flawed consumer control measure against those who would go without cable and a direct action against companies that have actually innovated over the past decade rather than sit pretty on a monopoly. 

**Why this is flawed:**


**There is no guarantee of accuracy or transparency:**

Regardless of your stance on the matter there should be no argument that internet usage amounts should be accurate and transparent to users affected by it. However that is not the case at all, there is no third party government agency in charge of regulating broadband metering. Comcast contracts out its metering to a third party vendor and its methods of measurement are internal and not open to the public at all. Just this year alone Comcast has received [thirteen thousand complaints about their data caps and their terrible accuracy in measurement](https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/The-FCC-Has-Received-13000-Complaints-About-Comcast-Data-Caps-135895).  Almost everyone who has to deal with this caps seems to have a story of their ISP charging them for data usage that would be impossible given their current bandwidth. 

**Discourages cord cutting and stifles competition:** 

Data caps exist solely as a consumer control measure to stifle competition and cause users to be biased against applications based on the data amount they use. For example [Netflix which lists high quality HD as using 3 GB per hour and Ultra HD as using 7gb per hour](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) is immediately affected by this. As Ultra HD becomes more common and using 7gb of data for an hour of video streaming becomes common place users affected by data caps will hit their limits more easily causing them to be charged overages. This will cause users to drop Netflix in favor of less data intensive services which Comcast will only be too happy to provide through cable. Families of five living in a home with heavy Netflix usage will already be pushing this current limit.

This isn't just for videos of course, people who use services like Steam will be hit just as hard especially as the size of games increases, data intensive services that would have otherwise been developed will languish on the vine as data caps cause consumers to be biased against them.  

**Users have little choice in what ISP they must subscribe to:**

The Internet is no longer a luxury that most can live without. For many it has become an essential utility much like electricity.

In any thread regarding complaints against Comcast or any ISP for that matter the main complaint of users is that they have no choice in their ISP (""Save us Google Fiber!""). Those lucky enough to live in major metropolitan areas may be fortunate enough to have the choice of maybe two or more ISPs but for many users the local ISP is the only choice they have which grants that business a monopoly in their area. In a happier world there would be dozens of ISPs each competing with each other and vying for market share so the poor behavior of one company only provides an opportunity for another to gain more customers. Sadly most Americans don't live in that kind of free economic environment. 


**What we need to do:**

How do consumers collectively fight this when they have little recourse in their choice of ISP?
The FCC is currently investigating data caps as a practice. If we as consumers just accept data caps the FCC will have less reason to crack down so it is imperative that the public puts pressure on the FCC. We're back to the Net Neutrality fight all over again as data caps are just a proxy issue that allows Comcast to achieve the same thing it wanted with its draconian net neutrality rules. 

Some users may be currently exempt from data caps but this behavior will absolutely roll down hill to other ISPs once they realize that consumers will accept it. Then you'll have to deal with your own little small town version of Comcast with little recourse. 

Much like the behavior of the last Net Neutrality fight calling the FCC directly has a huge impact. 

FCC Complaint Line:1-888-225-5322

[If you can't call directly you can file an online form to register your complaint.](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824)

Like before we need to raise public awareness of this issue and flood the FCC with our complaints and input so we don't have to deal with a stifled internet. 

**EDIT 1:**
Some users have mentioned that the online forum and phone line isn't working out for them.
Another number that you can use to submit a comment or complaint.

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler: (202) 418-1000

This was also a number we used to contact in order to urge Tom Wheeler to stand for Net Neutrality once again we can call and urge Mr. Wheeler to stand with the internet once again. However please remember that there are real people on the other side of the line. 



**EDIT 2:**

**If you so choose to give the office of Tom Wheeler((202) 418-1000) or the FCC complaint line(1-888-225-5322) a call here's a handy script you can use. Feel free to add on or improvise on this:**

""I'm calling FCC Chairman Wheeler to urge him to stand with Internet users and pass strong, loophole-free rules against so called Data Caps. There is no legitimate, technical reason for these data caps. Comcast itself [admitted](https://gizmodo.com/comcast-will-cap-more-peoples-data-because-of-fairness-1740913276) in [internal customer service guidelines that these caps aren’t about network congestion](https://i.imgur.com/quf68FC.jpg). Instead, it claims these data caps are about “fairness,” but the broadband industry continues to see higher revenues and profits with lower costs overall and there’s no argument that these caps are based on any “fair” costs that Internet usage causes. The real reason behind these caps is to protect Comcast’s monopoly over cable TV, making it more expensive for customers to “cut the cord” even if they want to choose other video options. And by exempting only its own online video application from the cap, Comcast gives Stream TV an advantage over all competing online video applications. ""

Replace Comcast with your own local ISP or ISPs in general. 

*Script and sources shamelessly lifted from [Battleforthenet](https://www.battleforthenet.com/?title-x-committees=1#top).


**EDIT 3:**

The key to this fight will sadly not be a single set of calls made to the FCC but rather a sustained campaign of public pressure and complaint. Long after this thread's karma decays and it falls off the pages people still need let their voices be heard. There will be more threads in the future to bring attention to this we wont go down without a fight.

The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

Oh, and I'm also the UFC Bantamweight Champion and undefeated in MMA. I'm here today to answer your questions with the help of my friends Bobby and Leo. 

As many of you already know, I get a **lot** of questions about femininity and body image. Women are constantly being made to feel the need to conform to an almost unattainable standard of what’s considered attractive so they can support a multitude of industries buying shit in the pursuit of reaching this standard. 

So, I've decided to expand my support of the charity Didi Hirsch with their work in the field of women's body issues, and have partnered with Represent.com to [release a limited edition ""don't be a D.N.B."" shirt](http://represent.com/ronda), with a portion of proceeds benefiting this amazing cause. (For those of you who don't know- a ""D.N.B."" is a ""Do Nothing Bitch"")

I'll be answering your questions for the next ~34 seconds, so I'll have plenty of time for 50+ thoughtful answers.

It’s [the one that I will wear on my funeral](http://i.imgur.com/Ln8Yyqf.jpg?1) a few months from now. It may not match my suit, but I think it’s perfect for the occasion. 

The cancer diagnosis came too late to give me at least a tenuous hope for a long life, but I realized that the most important thing about death is to ensure that you leave this world a little better than it was before you existed with your contributions . The way I’ve lived my life so far, my existence or more precisely the loss of it, will not matter because I have lived without doing anything impactful.

Before, there were so many things that occupied my mind.  When I learned how much time I had left, however, it became clear which things are really important. So, I am writing to you for a selfish reason. I want to give meaning to my life by sharing with you what I have realized:

* Don’t waste your time on work that you don’t enjoy.
It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something that you don’t like.
Patience, passion, and dedication come easily only when you love what you do.

* It’s stupid to be afraid of others’ opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and go with it. Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you‘re a legend.

* Take control of your life
Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don’t procrastinate. **Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn’t.**

* Appreciate the people around you
Your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn’t take them for granted. 

It is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is. 

I'm not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful. I only regret that I will not be able to see a lot of cool stuff that should happen soon like the creation of AI, or Elon Musk’s next awesome project. I also hope that the war in Syria and Ukraine will end soon.

We care so much about the health and integrity of our body that until death, we don’t notice that the body is nothing more than a box - a parcel for delivering our personality, thoughts, beliefs and intentions to this world. If there is nothing in this box that can change the world, then it doesn’t matter if it disappears. I believe that we all have potential, but it also takes a lot of courage to realize it.  

You can float through a life created by circumstances, missing day after day, hour after hour. Or, you can fight for what you believe in and write the great story of your life. 
I hope you will make the right choice.

Leave a mark in this world. 
Have a meaningful life, whatever definition it has for you. Go towards it. The place we are leaving is a beautiful playground, where everything is possible. Yet, we are not here forever. Our life is a short spark in this beautiful little planet that flies with incredible speed to the endless darkness of the unknown universe. So, enjoy your time here with passion. Make it interesting. Make it count!

Thank you!

"[Theory] Jar Jar Binks was a trained Force user, knowing Sith collaborator, and will play a central role in The Force Awakens",66412,3qvj6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/3qvj6w/theory_jar_jar_binks_was_a_trained_force_user/,8205,1446231933.0,"Here I will seek to establish that Jar Jar Binks, far from being simply the bumbling idiot he portrays himself as, is in fact a highly skilled force user in terms of martial ability and mind control. 

Furthermore, I assert that he was not, as many people assume, just an unwitting political tool manipulated by Palpatine-- rather, he and Palpatine were likely in collaboration from the very beginning, and it's entirely possible that Palpatine was a subordinate underling to Binks throughout both trilogies.  

And finally, given the above, I will conclude with an argument as to why I believe it is not only possible, but *plausible* that Jar Jar will make a profound impact on the upcoming movies, and what his role may be.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

So first, let's **establish Jar Jar as a skilled warrior.**  While this does not in itself necessitate a connection with the Physical Force, it's highly suggestive in the Star Wars universe-- very rarely do we see ""normal"" characters exhibiting extraordinary stuntwork or physical feats unless they are Jedi, Sith, or at least force sensitives.

So here's [Jar Jar nonchalantly executing a standing 20 foot twisting somersault](http://gfycat.com/ThirstyEverlastingAmericanbittern).

Now, taken out of context, if you were watching a Star Wars movie and saw a character casually execute this maneuver, you'd probably assume it was a Jedi.  *In* the context of Jar Jar, though, we don't... because elsewhere he so thoroughly convinces us that he's nothing more than a harmless dunce with his inane dialogue and cowardly-lion act.

He also manages to convince us that he's a bumbling oaf in the midst of pitched battle... even though he's *always* incredibly, amazingly successful.  Whether single-handedly taking down a battledroid tank, or unleashing a barrage of boombas on their front lines, or precisely targeting multiple enemies with a blaster tangled around his ankle (!!!), we simply roll our eyes and attribute it to dumb ""luck.""  

But is it? [Obi-Wan warned us otherwise.](http://i.imgur.com/Y233Zgb.png)

This is one of the main reasons we as an audience hate Jar Jar so thoroughly;  he breaks the fourth wall, he he shatters our suspension of disbelief, because we know that no one is *really* that lucky.  We dismiss it as a lame, cliched trope-- the silly pathetic oaf who always seems to inadvertently save the day.

I posit that, instead, this is a deliberate facade on the part of Jar Jar as a character, and on the part of the writers and animators.  As we know, the Jedi themselves are inspired by Shaolin Monks, and there's a particular kung fu discipline that Jar Jar's physicality is purposefully modeled upon which allows him to appear goofy and uncoordinated even as he lays waste to his enemies; namely, [Zui Quan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zui_quan), or Drunken Fist wushu.  This discipline seeks to imitate the ""sloshing,"" seemingly random foibles of a drunkard, but in reality the staggering and stumbling is the use of bodily momentum, deception, and unpredictability intended to lure and confuse opponents.

Let's take a look at Jar Jar displaying some wushu (the compasion clips are taken from [an instructional Zui Quan video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU9-3J9CQwE)):

(if you [slow down the above gif](http://gfycat.com/EnormousColorfulIbisbill#?speed=0.125), you'll notice how Jar Jar *dodges* an incoming blaster shot at the very beginning. You'll also notice how he's mysteriously aware of the droideka as it appears behind him, even though it isn't in his line of sight and he couldn't possibly hear it over the din of battle....)

...ok, that's all well and good, but even *if* Jar Jar is a secret Drunken Fist boxing master, that doesn't make him a force user, right?  Well, it should at least make us suspicious of his character period.  It establishes that his over-the-top, childish antics are a veneer masking a more complex character than we're led to believe.  But even if you choose to ignore Jar Jar's seemingly magical prescience in battle, I believe that there is a particular scene in which we do see him *clearly* make use of the physical force...

In TPM, when Jar Jar and the Jedi ambush the droids and rescue the queen and her entourage, Jar Jar ""accidentally"" botches his leap from the balcony.  A few frames later, he is seen dropping from the *opposite* side of the balcony, which would seem to be quite be impossible without a force assisted jump and/or force sprint of some kind.  Let's take a look at the full scene:

[Jar Jar Ambush](http://gfycat.com/PrestigiousDefensiveBordercollie)

(Note that as they sneak up, Jar Jar is just as effortlessly stealthy as his Jedi counterparts.  Interesting.)

Now as I said, we see Jar Jar catch hold of the balcony on the far right side, but then he drops to the ground on the far left.  Easy to dismiss as a continuity or framing error, I suppose... except that one of the droids continues to fire on Jar Jar's initial position, even as we see him drop elsewhere!

[Here it is in slow-motion](http://gfycat.com/LinearAgreeableArachnid#?speed=0.5)

See the droid that comes charging up, right behind the one Qui-Gon chops down?  What's he shooting at up there??  And see its head swing back towards Jar Jars new position after the shot? You can also see another droid behind it tracking Jar Jar with its head, and manage a shot on the new position.  This means that the animators knew very well where Jar Jar was *supposed* to be- dangling from the balcony over Qui-Gon's left shoulder- and purposefully animate the droids tracking his inexplicably fast movement elsewhere.

I think what has happened here, even though we don't see it directly, is that Jar Jar has purposefully split the attention of the enemies by grabbing on to the balcony as he falls, and then (using the force) propelled himself with a pull-up/flip to land in an unexpected place.

In fact, [this is a maneuver we've seen before](http://gfycat.com/ChiefForcefulJellyfish)... from a jedi.  Twice, if you want to count Obi-Wan doing it in the Duel of Fates to take Maul by surprise.

In addition to this kind of highly suspicious physical ""luck,"" I also believe that we're given enough clues to justifiably suspect that **Jar Jar is also a master of Jedi Mind Control.**

Consider: We hate the way Jar Jar influences major plot points for the same reason we hate his physicality- *it messes with our sense of realism*.  Two experienced Jedi on a serious mission would never *actually* bring someone that stupid along with them.  No character that idiotic would ever *really* be made a general.  They certainly wouldn't be made a senator.  How could anyone like Jar Jar really convince the entire galaxy to abandon democracy? That's ridiculous.  

These things are just the political version of his physical ""luck.""  Inadvertent, seemingly comical bumbling that *just so happens* to result in astoundingly positive results.  But what if it isn't inadvertant, and what if Jar Jar's meteoric rise and inexplicable influence isn't the result of dumb happenstance, but the result of extensive and careful use of force mind powers?

Jedi (and presumably Sith) exhibit telltale signs when using the Mind Trick to implant suggestions or influence behavior.  For one, [they always gesticulate](http://gfycat.com/InferiorPoliteIsopod) and [not-so-subtly wave their hands at the target.](http://gfycat.com/DarlingWellgroomedIchthyostega) 

Here's a look at some pivotal Jar Jar moments during his political career:

[Jar Jar hand-waving his way towards a promotion to Bombad General]

[Jar Jar hand-waving his way towards a promotion to the Senate]
(http://gfycat.com/LameImmaterialEwe)

[Jar Jar using Force Persuasion as he hand-waves the entire Galactic Senate](http://gfycat.com/CheerfulHugeDutchsmoushond) and ushers in the death of democracy.

Actually, if you watch the prequels with the idea that Jar Jar might be a manipulative, dark character, you begin to notice just how insidious and subtle his manipulation is, and how effective, in almost every sequence he's involved in, and also just how hyper-aware of the overarching plot he really is.  

Examples: Jar Jar tricking the Jedi into traveling through the planet core (so that they need him).  Jar Jar carefully causing a scene so that they run into Anakin.  Jar Jar constantly mocking Qui-Gon behind his back while Anakin is watching (so that Anakin learns disrespect for Jedi authority early on).  Jar Jar telling an 8 year old child that the queen is ""pretty hot,""  fanning the flames of the child's infatuation that is exploited later on.  I could go on.  

Now if you lend even the slightest credence to my above points, and acknowledge the possibility that Jar Jar might *not* be an idiot, you're almost forced to conclude that **Jar Jar Binks and Palpatine were co-conspirators.**  If Jar Jar is putting forth an elaborate act to deceive people, it means he's not a fool... and if he's not a fool, it means his actions in Episode II that facilitate Palpatine's plans are not those of an unwitting tool- they are those of a *partner.* 

Remember- Palpatine and Jar Jar are from the same planet, which in the scale of the Star Wars universe is like growing up as next door neighbors.  It's entirely possible that they knew each other for years prior to TPM-- perhaps they trained together, or one trained the other.  And Naboo is a really strange planet, actually; remember those [odd ancient statues](http://i.imgur.com/yXgDgaF.jpg) with the third eye?  Naboo is the kind of place an ""outcast"" Gungan might find a Sith holocron or two.  

But that's just speculation.  Let's stick to what we know-- what we know is that even after Palpatine is elected as Chancellor, *years* after Jar Jar has been ""tricked"" into helping elect him, [Palpatine *still* hangs out with Jar Jar in RotS.](http://i.imgur.com/Ues6Llm.jpg).  Why?  Wouldn't he be a constant source of public embarrassment?  This is the same character who can't walk five yards without stepping in poodoo or squealing like a rabid donkey, right?  What use does he have now?   Why is he still at the right hand of the most powerful person in the galaxy?   Could it be that in fact Jar Jar ***is*** the most powerful person in the galaxy?

Fine.  Maybe.  Hilarious conspiracy theory, but why would George Lucas bother to create this devious Gungan character with an elaborate conspiratorial past, but then never actually reveal his true nature?

Here's George Lucas (from a documentary) talking about Yoda:

""Yoda really comes from a tradition in mythological storytelling- fairy tales- of the hero finding a little creature on the side of the road **that seems very insignificant and not very important**, but who turns out to be the master wizard, or the master thing...""

As we all know, one of Lucas' big deals with the prequels was that they were intended to ""rhyme"" and mirror the original trilogy in terms of general narrative themes.  So there *should* have been a seemingly innocent creature found on the side of the road that later reveals itself as a major player.  We *do* have a creature that this seems to describe precisely... Jar Jar... but of course he never develops into a ""master"" anything.

Here's what I think happened:  I think that Jar Jar was initially intended to be the prequel (and Dark Side) equivalent of Yoda.  Just as Yoda has his ""big reveal"" when we learn that his tottering, geriatric goofball persona is just a mask, Jar Jar was intended to have a big reveal in Episode II or III where we learn that he's not really a naive dope, but rather a master puppeteer Sith in league with (or perhaps in charge of) Palpatine. 

However, GL chickened out.  The fan reaction to Jar Jar was so vitriolic that this aspect of the trilogy was abandoned.  Just too risky... if Jar Jar is truly that off-putting, it's potentially ruinous to the Star Wars legacy to imply that he's the ultimate bad guy of the *entire saga*.  So pretend he was just a failed attempt at comic relief instead.  

This is why Dooku seems like such a flat, shoehorned-in character with no backstory; he was hastily written in to cover the plot holes left when villain Jar Jar was redacted.  Yoda was meant to duel with his literal darkside nemesis and mythological equivalent at the end of AotC: not boring old Count Dooku, but *Sith Master Jar Jar*.  And Binks was meant to escape, not just that duel but to survive the entire trilogy... so that he could cast a shadow on the OT, too; you'd rewatch the originals knowing that the Emperor wasn't necessarily the big baddie after all... Jar Jar is still out there somewhere.  It would have been sort of brilliant.

***But*** I believe it is likely that the writers of the new trilogy will resurrect this idea.  Most people seem to think that Disney wishes to distance or somehow disassociate itself from the prequels... but this doesn't actually make any economic or marketing sense.  There is far more prequel-era based intellectual property to capitalize on than there is OT, if only because of the Clone Wars movie and series.  Billions of dollars in iconic toys, images, characters, games, park rides, etc that an entire younger generation grew up on.  Disney is not going to pretend that *over half* of the $4 billion in IP they bought simply isn't worth acknowledging.  

(and anyway, we have [behind the scenes TFA footage](http://i.imgur.com/SZwUBjd.jpg) clearly showing imagery being reused from the prequels.  Also, many of the flags above Maz's castle in the trailer are from TPM)

No, it stands to reason that one of their primary goals will be to reinvigorate and ultimately try to redeem the prequels in the eyes of the fanbase.  To elevate and improve them retroactively, as much as possible.  So how do you do that?

Jar Jar Binks has undoubtedly become the face of everything that is ""wrong"" with the prequels- he was too silly, too unbelievable, seemingly pointless.  If you are able to somehow change the nature of Jar Jar from embarrassing idiot to jaw-dropping villain, suddenly the entire prequel trilogy must be seen in a new light, because it becomes the setup for the most astounding reveal in film history:

**Jar Jar Binks is Supreme Leader Snoke!**

In Russia, there is a law which allow Roskomnadzor, Russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. Two years ago I tested how RKN react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. On of that websites was Reddit.

One thing I learned is that RKN doesn't want to block popular websites. They respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. [It was on 05/21/2013](https://img.bi/#/VN0xdFz!SUfwaAZuQ0OgFP6nJQpMgqpwENsQfA4KLn1gdqhZ). On 10st Aug 2015 they posted [a call to help them contact Reddit administration](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official VK page. Funny thing, but they called Psilocybe a plant. Several hours ago they [reported that Reddit is blocked in Russia](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). Seems like things changed.

How Reddit is blocked? Fully. As Reddit switched to HTTPS, there is no way to block special page.

Will I remove this post? No. I also think that Reddit administration needs to do nothing. This is important issue on freedom of speech, and only RKN want to violate it.

BTW, this post is a guide for indoor growing Psilocybe mushrooms in Russian. I'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read Russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to RKN.

UPD: [Russia unbans Reddit](https://meduza.io/en/news/2015/08/13/russia-unblocks-reddit) as they comply with request and blocked that post for Russian users.

You may have seen - my first album since 1993 is out today! You can get 50 on [iTunes, Amazon or Spotify](http://smarturl.it/RickAstleyS01), or even get the vinyl and signed photograph version on my [website](https://rickastley.tmstor.es/). 

But other than the album, I'm really excited to be hopping on Reddit today to talk with you guys! This is going to be a lot of fun, and I can't wait to get started.

I'll be here at 3pm ET to answer your questions, and u/courtiebabe420 will be joining me in person to help. She'll also help get proof up when we get started later today. 

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rickastley), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/rickastley), or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/officialrickastley/) and check out my music on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/RickastleyCoUkOfficial) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0gxyHStUsqpMadRV0Di1Qt).

Okay - keep the questions coming. See you guys at 3pm (eastern) today!

Edit: [Proof](https://twitter.com/rickastley/status/784460789113430016)

Let's get started!

Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, the area around the parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water.

NASA TRAPPIST-1 News Briefing (recording) http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/100200725
For more info about the discovery, visit https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/trappist1/

This discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – key to life as we know it – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.

At about 40 light-years (235 trillion miles) from Earth, the system of planets is relatively close to us, in the constellation Aquarius. Because they are located outside of our solar system, these planets are scientifically known as exoplanets.

We're a group of experts here to answer your questions about the discovery, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, and our search for life beyond Earth. Please post your questions here. We'll be online from 3-5 p.m. EST (noon-2 p.m. PST, 20:00-22:00 UTC), and will sign our answers. Ask us anything! 

**UPDATE (5:02 p.m. EST):** That's all the time we have for today. Thanks so much for all your great questions. Get more exoplanet news as it happens from http://twitter.com/PlanetQuest and https://exoplanets.nasa.gov

[Here's a rough schematic of what the code looks like without revealing any trade secrets or compromising the integrity of the algorithm.](https://i.redd.it/dastklohq01y.gif)  Many of these rules are still quite useful, but there are a few whose primary impact has been [to sometimes artificially deflate scores on the site](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/z1sfn/one_minute_obamas_ama_karma_score_was_16000_a/).  


Unfortunately, determining the impact of all of these rules is difficult without doing a drastic recompute of all the vote scores historically… so we did that!  Over the past few months, we have carefully recomputed historical votes on posts and comments to remove outdated, unnecessary rules. 


Very soon (think hours, not days), we’re going to cut the scores over to be reflective of these new and updated tallies.  A side effect of this is many of our seldom-recomputed listings (e.g., pretty much anything ending in /top) are going to initially display improper sorts. Please don’t panic. Those listings are computed via regular (scheduled) jobs, and as a result those pages will gradually come to reflect the new scoring over the course of the next four to six days.  We expect there to be some shifting of the top/all time queues.  New items will be added in the proper place in the listing, and old items will get reshuffled as the recomputes come in.  


To support the larger numbers that will result from this change, we’ll be updating the score display to switch to “k” when the score is over 10,000. Hopefully, this will not require you to further edit your subreddit CSS.   


**TL;DR** voting is confusing, we cleaned up some outdated rules on voting, and we’re updating the vote scores to be reflective of what they actually are. Scores are increasing by a lot. 

**Edit**: The scores just updated.  Everyone should now see ""k""s.  Remember: it's going to take about a week for top listings to recompute to reflect the change. 

**Edit 2**: K -> k ",top_subreddit,0,2016-12-06 14:48:08

We’re privacy advocates trying to stop it. Join us and call your lawmaker to vote no on the bill: https://stopcyberspying.com and https://decidethefuture.org

The reason you keep hearing about these bills is that we keep beating them. The other side has full time lobbyists pushing them every single day. We have you. But together, we keep winning.

With your help, we've stopped CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, and other ""cybersecurity"" bills for years; however, they keep on coming back. Last week, the Senate scheduled CISA for a  final vote TOMORROW. We've been here before. And you already know the bill is a [surveillance bill in disguise](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/eff-strongly-oppose-cisa-cyber-surveillance-bill-and-cfaa-amendment).

People have sent millions of faxes (you read that right) to Congress, tweeted at senators, sent emails, and made calls. Over 50 organizations and companies oppose the bill including Access, ACLU, EFF, FFTF, Apple, Yelp, Twitter, and Wikimedia.

Fortunately, CISA isn’t law yet, but it will have its final Senate vote this week and we need a dozen more senators to vote against it. Two things you can do right now:

* [Call your lawmakers to vote no on the bill this week] (https://www.stopcyberspying.com) 

* [This is the fastest way to tweet at your senators](https://www.decidethefuture.org)

Or just call this and we can connect you: 1-985-222-CISA

I am the co-founder of [New Culture](https://www.newculture.co.nz/), we are a recently funded vegan food/biotech startup that is making cow cheese without the cow.

I did an AMA on r/vegan last week and that went well so it was suggested I do one here.

We believe that great vegan cheese is the final frontier of this plant-based/clean foods movement. We have seen lab-grown meat and fat but very few dairy products. This is because dairy and especially cheese is one of those foods that is actually very very complicated and very unique in its structure and components. This makes it very difficult to mimic with purely plant-based ingredients which is why vegan hard cheeses are not great.

So we are taking the essential dairy proteins that give all the traits of dairy cheese that we love (texture, flavour, behaviour etc) and using microbes instead of a cow to produce them. We are then adding plant-based fats and sugars and making amazing tasting cheese without any animals :)

I wasn't aroused as I usually was and even though I wanted to go through with it, after a while it was physically painful for me to do so. So I told him to stop.

Immediately he got off me and asked if I'm ok, and I started to cry. To be honest I was frustrated because I really wanted to have sex but I just couldn't. And I felt bad for him because he was enjoying it. He told me not to worry and to relax, that he didn't want to have sex with me if I wasn't enjoying it. He said we'd try again tomorrow, and that the blue balls was nothing because my well being comes first. We then relaxed and cuddled/talked for the rest of the night.

I just feel happy  to have a partner I can trust so much and I wanted to share this experience with someone. I've never felt so respected and loved from anyone else!

Edit: To the people saying that this should be the norm. Yes, it should. I'm not congratulating him for not being a rapist, it just made me happy that he cared for me so well. Also, where the fuck did I say that all men are rapists? This is about how I felt, not some man-hating bullshit.

As I was applying the cream to her upper thigh she shifted her body because of the pain, and my fingers slipped and one entered her vagina, I was shocked and took about half a second to remove it as was a bit taken aback, I apologised about 20 times.Doris just looked at me with a big smile and said, ""don't worry dear, it happens"" then chuckled and said ""it's been a while""I must have washed my hands about 30 times and questioned my career choice, colleagues thought it was hilarious.Next day an old man in a hoist shit on my converse and it soaked through to my sock... I realised I wasn't cut out for this job and handed my notice in there and then.

Edit: I was wearing gloves... but scrubbed the shit out of my hands anyway as it was fucking horrific.

2. When we started dating he was very clear that he had donated sperm in the past

3. I never asked him how much but just assumed it was just a couple of kids

4. Actually ask him last week and he tells me the fertility centres last updated him at 47 kids

I was... Not expecting that many. 

It's clearly my fault for not asking how many. At the time, I literally said I ""didn't care"" about his sperm donation and ""didn't want to know"", so I can't blame him for not telling me how many. I literally told him not to.

....But 47?! Christ!!!!

I can't stop thinking about all the problems this will cause when we're older. 

WIBTA for divorcing him for something that he was very upfront about?!?!

Edit: I forgot to mention. All the kids are legally entitled to his contact details when they turn 18",hot_subreddit,0,2019-04-07 18:31:31

So I'm pretty much convinced my gf killed my snake that I had since I was kid. 

She always had a problem with the snake, she would believe its satanic and bad omen to have a snake in the house. 

But to me the snake was like family, and is very docile. He has no problems with her dogs, he just be chilling. Even her dog would just chill, not attack my snake.

When we were moving she kept telling me to get rid of the snake but I couldnt cuz I really love my snake.

Well now I came home and the snake was just gone, no traces of anything just gone and not tp be seen in the house. 

When I confronted my gf about it she claims she doesnt know anything and claims that it probablt escaped.

I find this hard to believe because first off he actually cant escape his enclosure, and I doubt the snake went down a flight of stairs and left through the door.

I dont wanna make a big deal out of it but i think its mad fucked up she did this.

I wanna confront her about it but I dont wanna seem like Im being petty

EDIT: When I brought up the snake missing she just started crying and saying I always do this?? Idek what she even means by this

I heard he spent time with the traveling community to get to grips with the accent. 

Vinnie Jones was menacingly good as Bullet-Tooth Tony. His Desert Eagle 5.0 speech is a thing of beauty. He had some other decent roles but I didn't see him this good again until I stumbled upon him in an episode of Elementary where he stole every scene he was in. 

Statham looks fresh faced and plays it nicely along side Stephen Graham as they try and wangle their way out of Bricktop's back pocket - and the impending trip to his pig farm. 

Boris 'The Blade' Yurinov is an unbelievably hillarious character: ""You can keep the 10 grand, along with the body. But if I see you again - YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!"" Brilliant and effortlessly played by Rade Serbedzija (the tramp in Batman Begins). 

The late Mike Reid as Doug the Head was a great bit of casting considering he was so well known for appearing in Eastenders which still is a popular and successful English soap opera. 

Benicio Del Toro as Frankie Four Fingers, and Dennis Farina as Cousin Avi play it to a tee and show the locals they can go toe-to-toe...""open the dog!!"" 😂

Great film, great lines, tight pace, unexpected twists, hilarious scenes, and strong performances all over the place expertly weaved together. The music and sound effects were perfect as well. 

Glad I can appreciate it all these years later after the imitators have come and gone. ",hot_subreddit,0,2019-04-07 18:37:16

So, a bit of back story, my BF's boss is a bit of a dick, but unfortunately, he's also his uncle.

My bf works in I.T. He handles a lot of complaints regarding servers and general IT stuff. For the past three years he has worked overtime for free. (It's difficult to say no to family). He answers his personal phone and has to drive long distances to fix problems clients are having, sometimes at 10 at night. 

Recently, we've been trying to save money to make a life together. So my bf decided to ask the boss to finally get paid for all the overtime hours he will be working from now on. The boss is livid. He states that he will not pay my bf overtime money and he shouldn't ask again and that he should be grateful for his job. He concludes by saying that there is NO SUCH THING AS OVERTIME IN THIS BUSINESS!!

&#x200B;

Can you see where the malicious compliance comes in yet? ;)

So my bf now does not answer any calls after 5 or before 8. The boss now has to take all those calls and drive the ridiculous distances himself. BF gets called in and is asked why he isn't picking up his phone because the clients are getting really upset at him.  Bf's answer ""I'm sorry, but you said.... there is no such thing as overtime"".

"In 1970, 11-year-old Terrence Bowers was on a camping trip with Boy Scout Troop 275 in Chester County, Pennsylvania. In the early hours of the morning, fellow Scouts discovered Terrence dead in his sleeping bag, surrounded by a pool of blood. Terrence had been fatally stabbed several times.",2300,bahwx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/bahwx6/in_1970_11yearold_terrence_bowers_was_on_a/,260,1554653860.0,"On April 26, 1970, at approximately 7:30 AM, 11-year-old Terrence “Terry” Bowers was found deceased, suffering from multiple stab wounds, in his sleeping bag while on a Boy Scout’s camping trip in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The camping trip began on Friday, April 24, when Boy Scout Troop 275 traveled from Upper Darby to St. Basil the Great Church, East Pikeland Township, Chester County. Twenty three scouts and their six adult leaders set up camp on an open field near a creek about 200 yards from the church building, just beginning their much anticipated trip. 

After setting up the camp site, the scouts spent their day engaging in typical Boy Scout activities. Nobody noticed anything strange about any of the children’s behavior, including Terrence. The children rolled out their sleeping bags and went to sleep in a circular fashion around the campfire. Tents were pitched, but some scouts only slept in their tents if they had gotten cold from sleeping outside. It wasn’t until the early hours of the morning when fellow scouts discovered Terrence, motionless in his green sleeping bag, surrounded by a pool of his own blood. The medical examiner determined that Terrence was likely murdered just an hour prior to his discovery, about 6:30 AM. Terrence suffered stab wounds to his back, right arm, and chest. There was no indication that Terrence had been sexually assaulted. The medical examiner believed that the knife used to murder Terrence was a small blade. Though twenty two other scouts and two adult leaders were only feet away from Terrence at the time of his murder, there were no witnesses. Nobody had even heard anything unusual. 

The investigation was hexed from the beginning. By the time the authorities arrived, Terrence’s body had been moved and parents were on the scene. In the days and weeks after the murder, hundreds of people in northern Chester County were questioned by a six-man police investigation team. Boy Scouts were hooked up to polygraph machines and had their knives confiscated for evidence. The murder weapon was never recovered, despite three searches with metal detectors. There were no witnesses, no suspects, no motive, and no murder weapon. Investigators were dumbfounded by the random and brutal attack. Just days after the murder occurred, investigators already found themselves facing a dead end.

All scouts and leaders were questioned extensively. Their stories of their whereabouts at the time of the murder were all verified. Authorities investigated patients from the nearby mental facilities, Pennhurst State Hospital and Valley Forge Military Hospital, who were AWOL (Absent Without Official Leave) or out on passes. Each Sunday around sunrise, police set up a checkpoint near the church to ask drivers if they had seen anything unusual on the morning of the murder. Still, there were no viable suspects that could be linked to Terrence. The only leads investigators would have wouldn’t emerge until 1972 and 1983. In 1972, investigators questioned a man who had newspaper clippings about Terrence’s case in his apartment. In 1983, an inmate reportedly claimed to have information about the case. Unfortunately, both leads went nowhere. 

In a short amount of time, the case went cold. It wasn’t until 2012 that the freshest lead would emerge. In The Boy Scouts’ “perversion files,” records that name pedophiles and others that the Scouts want to keep out of the organization, there were documents that included letters a Boy Scout wrote in 1971 referring to Lawrence Wakely, a former Scout who is currently serving time at a state prison for rape. These records indicated that Wakely once admitted to stabbing Terrence in retaliation for being kicked out of the Scouts. The confession was never reported in the news at the time, but James Wenner, a state police investigator, said he had interviewed a man who fit Wakely’s description around the time of the murder. Wenner said that Wakely’s confession lacked details that only the murderer would know, and though its known to be inaccurate and oftentimes inadmissible in court, Wakely failed a polygraph test. 

Though Terrence’s father passed away of a heart attack at the 48 in 1978, Terrence’s mother and siblings still seek justice for their son and brother. Terrence’s family struggle to comprehend who could have murdered their loved one. Terrence’s brother, Chris, who has a tattoo of Terrence’s portrait on his bicep, speculated, ""These are some of the biggest organizations in the world [Roman Catholic Church & Boy Scouts]. If they wanted to find out where a bunch of young boys were hanging out, they were privy to that information. If they wanted this thing shut down, they'd shut it down real fast. I think they did. But if this happened today, it would have been solved.""

Maureen, Terrence’s sister, suspects that someone from Troop 275 knows something. She said, “They were scared little boys then who are men now with children of their own. They might say, 'Yeah, I did hear something or see something.’ Anything is possible. I'd like to give my mother some closure in this lifetime. It haunts her every day.”

Almost 50 years later, the murder of Terence Bowers remains unsolved.

"Erstes Mal laut gegen ""Ausländer raus"" mich geäußert",2047,bahnd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/bahnd2/erstes_mal_laut_gegen_ausländer_raus_mich_geäußert/,303,1554652428.0,"Vor gut einer Stunde stand ich im Rossmann an der Kasse mit gut 20 Leute auf 3 Kassen verteilt.
Sonntag Hauptbahnhof Dresden und Dynamo Fans fluten die Straßen.

Alles ist okay bis 3 Fans reinkommen und schreien, ""erstmal alle Ausländer raus! Wir sind hier in DEUTSCHland!"" und dabei den schlecht rasierten toten Österreicher nachmachten und den Arm hebten.
Das ist das erste Mal, dass ich so öffentlich Leute begegnet bin und ich war völlig überrumpelt.
Gelähmt vor Entsetzen schaute ich mich um und ein paar Leute schüttelten den Kopf aber sonst kam da nichts.

Die drei Herren reihten sich dann eine älter Person weiter hinter mir in die Schlange rein und bevor ich konstruktiv irgendwelche Argumente hatte, sagte ich nur ""Entschuldigung, aber einfach nein, es ist Sonntag Nachmittag, hier sind Kinder"".

Die Herren sind dann sehr persönlich geworden und mein prolliger Frankfurter aus mir sprach dann nur ""Wollt ihr Stress, denn Stress könnt ihr haben. Draußen steht die Polizei und die hat bestimmt auch ein Wörtchen mitzusprechen"".

Der ältere Herr bat mich forsch weiterzulaufen, da sich eine 30cm große Lücke gebildet hatte zur nächsten Person in der Reihe.
Ein weiteres Mädchen murmelte was und wurde sofort eingeschüchtert.
Zu der erwähnten Polizei wurde nur erwidert, dass sie heute schon Kontakt mit der Polizei hatten und das kein Problem sei.

Aber niemand hat sonst etwas gesagt. Die deutsche Stille und das peinliche wegschauen wurde aktiviert.
Die Verkäuferin schaute anstrengend auf meine Hände als ich mein Geld zählte und ich wünschte ihr noch einen schönen Tag.

Sofort ging ich zu den Beamten am Eingang und wies sie hin, dass ein paar Herren mit rechten Parolen im Rossmann um sich schmeissen würden und die persönlichen Beleidigungen an einem Sonntag Mittag nicht gingen.

Die Beamten waren sichtlich unmotiviert sich die Sache mal anzuschauen. Und bewegten sich nur widerwillig im Schneckentempo in Richtung des Drogeriegeschäfts.

Ich musste dann auch weiter und meine Mitfahrgelegenheit finden.

Ich bin zutiefst erschüttert. Dass sowas am helligen Tage möglich ist, die Polizei unbeeindruckt wirkte und NIEMAND etwas sagte.

Zusätzlich ärgere ich mich was ich sagte und wie.
Und Frage mich nun wie man dagegen verbal vorgehen kann, ohne auf das Niveau runter zu gehen.

Eine so frontale Art hatte ich bisher nie gewählt und habe immernoch viel Adrenalin in mir und bin etwas ratlos wie ich in Zukunft das besser Kontern kann.

Danke fürs Lesen jetzt schon, ich musste das aus meinem System raus bringen.


 
Edit: Wörter 

Edit 2: Guten Morgen. Danke für das Silber und Gold, bin sehr überrascht und freue mich aber über die rigorose Beteiligung. 

Würde mir wünschen noch ein paar Ideen zu hören wie man so eine Situation in Zukunft besser verbal Kontra geben kann, das ist meiner Meinung nach leider etwas untergegangen.

Zusätzlich fällt es mir noch schwer herauszufiltern, ab wann man denn laut etwas sag, sprich es hieß hier, dass rechte Parolen kein Grund seien, die Polizei zu holen, da so etwas unter Meinungsfreiheit fällt und eine politische Meinung ist. Da verstehe ich denn Unterschied noch nicht wo der Unterschied zwischen rechte Parole und Rassismus ist? Und das rechte Parole nicht den Hitlergruß mitbeinhaltet wie ich angenommen habe?
Wäre nett, wenn da jemand noch ein bisschen Klarheit schaffen könnte.

Vielen Dank und einen guten Start in die Woche",hot_subreddit,0,2019-04-07 10:53:48

I am vape survivor,5719,bagmt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/bagmt8/i_am_vape_survivor/,139,1554646448.0,"I was vaped when I was 16 years old. It was 2 years ago, I was walking home, alone in the dark after a party filled with litty baes hittin that grass with the famjam. I was half drunk. I saw an older man following me about 30 meters back. No worries I thought to myself, I was a star athlete and I was a guy. Surely, someone thrice my age and twice my weight couldn't out run me. At least in my drunken thoughts, I hadn't found any reason to feel too threatened. He walked off towards a side street after I crossed an intersection. I thought it'd be done. 

He jumped out of the bushes at the next intersection at me, whipping out his long, hard, throbbing 6 inch vape pen. He blew in my face 9 square meters worth of vape. I became disorientated and fell down. Harder and harder he vaped at me, laughing at me for smoking cigs. I tried crying for help but I was too choked by the vapor to speak properly. He danced around me and blew a mighty fine vape circle at me, I caught it with my mouth and could feel the nicotine inside of me. Slowly burning my internal organs and making me into the crack addict I was born to become. He used up all his vape juice, threw his vape on the ground and ran away. 

I didn't think men could be vaped, and I questioned it. Was I really vaped? It took me many years but I've finally healed from my vaping experience. Every day, thousands of high schoolers are vaped in bathrooms and it only gets worse. Vaping is indiscriminate of gender. 

I was finna get litty with the famjam one day, passed my man and yeeted him a ""suh dude"". And I vaped him in the bathroom, something I didn't think I was capable of but I did. I've hated myself for it, and thought about it everyday since 1998 when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummeted through the announcer’s table.

In five years, you can see the results of your hard work, or you can sit there wishing you had started five years ago.",18728,baeo0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/baeo0q/text_time_will_pass_whether_youre_using_it_or_not/,342,1554629956.0,"One day, it will be 2024. You will still be you, except you won't be. Think back to the 2014 version of you. I bet you can barely recognize that person. Whether you're doing it intentionally or not, people change. You changed, and you will continue to change.

&#x200B;

We overestimate what we can do in one year and underestimate what we can do in five. It's so easy to think ""This is my year!"" or ""In 2019, I'm going to do X"", but a year really isn't all that much time. It's already April. Time flies. But you probably realized from thinking about your 2014 self that a lot changes in five years.

&#x200B;

In five years, you can be living a whole new life. You could have a family, a new career, live in a new country, or be that person you've always wanted to be who works out all the time and actually likes eating vegetables. All you need to do to get there is start working now. Start small, but start now.

&#x200B;

Don't get stuck thinking that you have tons of time. Remember how we're already into the fourth month of 2019? This year will be over before you know it. Get started. Small changes made every day for five years will amount to big things, and that time will pass whether you're using it or not.

Trump confirmed the news in a tweet, saying, ‘I would like to thank her for her service.’

* Edge Transit is a meme, not a joke. There's a difference. 


* If you haven't already, get you a Militia's Birthright or Orewing Maul. Ignore blast radius. It's a lie. You will have a need... for SPEED. Velocity. Quickdraw. Enhanced GL loader on your arms. Auto-loading holster. St0mp-EE5s. Transversive Steps. Dunemarchers. 10 mobility. Traction. Your enemies are Australia, and you are an emu. ***Be the bird.***


* However bad you think Sentinel hit registration is, GL hit registration is exactly 3.4x worse. Ever watched a melee bounce harmlessly between your enemy's legs? No. No you have not. 


* You will be tempted to try doing this in Competitive. You might even succeed in so doing. Some people also enjoy getting kicked in the balls. Your call on whether you're one of them. 


* Iron Banner works now--you can earn both double kills and Calculated Trajectory medals there, though it won't actually show the CT medals on screen. The real challenge is finding a match that lasts long enough to allow you to hit that crispy three-piece.


* Tethering multiple enemies allows you to line up the easy multikill, whiff, panic reload-dodge, shoot between their legs, and watch someone else mop up your disillusionment with their shotgun. 



* Some people play to hunt you, and you *personally*, once you achieve two GL final blows in a single life. It is their job to prevent your Calculated Trajectory medal. It is your job to end their hunt, because the rest of your team just flipped spawns and now you're all by yourself. Good luck!


* Targeting perks and Targeting Adjuster mods are bad ideas. Ever tried hitting someone with a projectile by shooting straight at them? Works about as well as you think it wouldn't. This is the one and only time Quick Access Sling is your friend. 


* Shoot all of your bullets. You're not gonna get lucky by sitting on 6 GL shots.


* Think of your breech-loader as a shitty Chaperone with bouncy bullets and a critbox that sits just above the spleen. Your goal is to make your targets regret eating before this Crucible match. 


* Camp heavy now, ask for forgiveness later. 


* Clip all of the bullshit plays you get, good and bad, and edit them into a montage to post to Reddit later so that I can watch them and feel better about myself. 


Now that you're prepped, get out there and earn your shiny new pocket rocket!

A Doctor loses everything.,2011,baiffv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NuclearRevenge/comments/baiffv/a_doctor_loses_everything/,150,1554656689.0,"This is a bit long, so bear with me. TLDR at end.

Background: I (F,59) was working as an RN in labor & delivery at a smallish hospital. I was the only staff nurse that had trained in high-risk OB plus critical/ ICU trained for infants. The doc involved was our only general practice doc that delivered infants. The rest were OB specific docs. So he's D and M is me. I had worked in the field for about 15 yrs at this point. 

We had a client scheduled to come in to have her labor induced. D had called, gave me her stats (2 wks overdue, 1st baby) and preliminary orders. No big deal. The woman came in with hubby, small bag, and a shitload of nervousness. No big deal. I'm a very chill, soothing RN to be around, somewhat of a mama hen seeing over her chicks. I proceed with assessments (BP, temp, weight, history, etc.) Then I measure her fundal height. This is a measurement from the top edge of her pubic bone to the top of her uterus. The number normally corresponds to the number of weeks she was pregnant. The measurement wasn't adding up for someone who's supposedly 2 wks over due. The measurement was only 26 cms. Way too low. I repeat it and have another nurse check: 26 cms. Instead of being overdue, she was 3 1/2 months EARLY. I got her settled in a birthing room, and went to call D. 

I told D that I was refusing to do the induction as baby was far too early. D: she's just tall. Do the damned induction. M: no, she's too early. D: she's just tall. Stop bothering me and start her induction. (Her height has nothing to do with the size of her baby. I'd also called my super to tell her I was refusing his orders.) M: no. I'm not doing this and the hospital is my boss, not you. You want it done, you come in and do it yourself. I refuse. This is inappropriate action against this patient and I'm not going to be your side-kick on this misadventure. D: I'm on my way.

He hangs up. I document the conversation and notify my super who stops by and co-signs my comment. 

10 min later, D walks in the door, and begins railing on me. I don't listen. (My job is to advocate FOR the patient, not to be the docs assessor to mistakes.) He goes in and WITHOUT checking fundal height, breaks her water. I thought 'well, we're riding down a dark path to hell with a broken wheel.' So, I settle in for a very preterm labor and no emergency neonatal intensive care at this hospital. I call the paramedics  and alert helicopter and NICU at the closest mega hospital. We were going to need them. 
Within 5 hrs we've got a VERY tiny 26 wk baby boy. M: (to my assistant), go ask D what neonatologist at (larger hospital) he wants. D: the baby's fine. We don't need that. M: going to the doc myself, carrying preemie with me. We need a neodoc and a helo stat. Get your act together. He follows me to the nursery when I continue ventilating the baby. D: what's the damned problem?! M: EVERYTHING! Baby doesn't even weight 2 lbs, can't breathe, is too early! What part of this mess don't you get?!!! D: I need to finish with mom. You do what you need to do. (Super there taking her own notes.) So, I intubate baby, and bag him while assist calls hosp NICU and helio. She holds the phone to my ear so I can give them the scoop. Assist then goes to stay with mom. 

Within 45 minutes, baby is in NICU at the larger hospital and is being cared for and mom was in postpartum. I give her the breakdown. She's tearfully angry as is hubby. Doc is long gone. Super is back Xeroxing my new mom's chart. I breathe a huge sigh of relief as the shit show is over. I leave at 6am for home. 

Next evening, D comes by bringing me a milkshake and offering apologies. I laugh at him. M: if you think a milkshake is going to get you in my good graces, you're wrong. But I'm still drinking this shake. D: what can I do to help? M: well, you can march your ass into that couple's room and offer to cover their million dollar neonatal bill for starters. (I'm not fond of docs as I've seen too many major issues they've caused.) D walks out without even seeing the couple. I call super about this. She laughs and tells me to keep those docs in line. Damn right.

Two days later, super stops by to tell me D will no longer be at this hospital as his privileges have been revoked. Two weeks later, ALL hospitals had revoked his privileges. Three months later and his license had been revoked. He could no longer practice medicine. I felt no pity for him. He should've listened to me. 

TLDR: Doc delivers preterm infant knowingly and loses his license. ",hot_subreddit,0,2019-04-07 12:04:49

I kept a baby from going to surgery today,4283,baiiql,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/baiiql/i_kept_a_baby_from_going_to_surgery_today/,97,1554657162.0,"I'm a radiologist, and this is my weekend to work. 14 hours Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It's a non-stop flogging. I've been feeling fairly burned out lately. You spend all day reading films, and some days you sit back and think, ""I haven't helped anyone today."" I missed opening day of little league yesterday and my boy's first t-ball game. I was feeling pretty low. 

Today, they brought in an 8 month old baby with  [intussusception. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intussusception_(medical_disorder)) As a radiologist, I get the opportunity to fix the problem. I have to do an enema to try to get the colon back into normal position. We typically try three times, and if we're not successful, the surgeons take over and open them up. 

I did my three tries, and got it about 95% fixed, but it has to be 100%. I looked at the surgeon, and he agreed to keep going. On the fourth try, the baby's belly was so distended. He was crying, my tech got sprayed in the face with contrast (very sticky and coming from the baby's butt) and I think the surgeons were getting ready to make the calls to get the OR ready. All of a sudden, BAM!, the contrast went where it was supposed to go and the problem was fixed!  No surgery!  The baby was suddenly quiet because it no longer hurt. The surgeons cheered because they didn't have to cut. Even the tech that was sprayed with dirty contrast was happy ( she said she'd wear it with pride today). 

This is the best day I've had in a long time and I really needed it.  I actually had to go back to my office to shed a little tear out of happiness. 

Now, back to work. Let the flogging resume. 


Edit:  Thank you for the gold and silver. 

I made this post because I was very happy about being able to avoid sending the baby to surgery. I see studies all the time that are knee-jerk ""send them to surgery"" cases.  I thanked my team a lot for their help, and I will certainly speak to their supervisor tomorrow.  

I realize that my reports are important, even my reports that have no acute findings. Being a radiologist, I seldom get to ""lay hands"" on a patient and even less often haveł such a positive outcome. So often, when I do deal directly with patients, it's too give bad news (I'm sorry, the fetus has died or I'm sorry, but I really think this is breast cancer, etc).   Seeing the relief on the baby's face when the intussusception was reduced was awesome. That baby had gone through a rough night and hadn't slept much. Two minutes after we were finished, the baby was sound asleep. 

I appreciate everyone's comments. There are no heroes here. Just a group of people doing what they are trained to do and honestly trying their best to do what's right for this child. Fortunately, this time we succeeded. ",hot_subreddit,0,2019-04-07 12:12:42

I had gone grocery shopping and was taking my stuff out to my truck in the cart. As I pull up to the truck I let the cart hit the bumper. All the sudden a Male Karen appears. 

MK: What the hell? You think that’s okay?

Me: Wut?

MK: What the fuck is wrong with you?!

Me: Sir, I don’t know-

MK: You hit that truck with the cart! I can’t believe you are so irresponsible. You should be fired for that!

I realize he thinks I work there. I tell him a basic, I don’t work here and start loading my groceries in the back as this dude yells at me. I thought dude would realize that it’s my truck I hit. He didn’t. 

MK: That thing is a classic! I want to see your manager because that was unacceptable. 

Turning to him because I don’t think he heard what I said, I repeated myself. 

Me: I don’t work here, dude. This is my- 

MK: Don’t give me that bullshit! I want to speak to your manager!

Then one of the guys that does work there came up. He asked if there was a problem. The dude started ranting at him that I had scrapped the cart along the truck after ramming it. He wanted me fired. 

The employee looks at me and asked if I was done with the cart so I could take it back. I said yes, grabbed my last bag I sat in the back. Then I went and got in my truck and started it up. The Male Karen’s face got rather red as I pulled away. 

For the record, my truck is a mid-'90's S-10. Technically a classic in my state, but not what I would think of as a classic. Also very rough condition. ",hot_subreddit,0,2019-04-07 11:42:54

[TP] Midna is the best sidekick. Change my mind.,2263,bahuav,https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/bahuav/tp_midna_is_the_best_sidekick_change_my_mind/,271,1554653457.0,"[Midna](https://i.imgtc.com/ZxTrK6k.png) is the best sidekick and here is why:

1. Her personality. Since the very first time you encounter Midna while in wolf form she consistently teases Link and makes jokes about those around her while asserting her dominance, providing comic relief in the Zelda game with arguably the darkest atmosphere. She also demonstrates that she has another more submissive side when she freaks out by seeing rats, even though she is cool with ghosts and scarier things.
2. She is useful. Although during the first half of the game she does not help much other than guidance, in the second half she provides an extremely useful service in the way of allowing Link to change to his wolf form whenever he wants. She also proves to be extremely powerful as demonstrated when she deals the final blow to Zant, as well as breaking the shield on Hyrule Castle.
3. She has character development. When Link first meets Midna she is selfish. She openly admits to using Link for her own benefit and does not care about him. Sure, her cooperation allows Link to save his friends, but she makes it clear that doing that is just a convenient outcome of her getting what she wants as well. Closer to mid-game and beyond she starts caring about Hyrule and it's people as demonstrated when she begs Zelda not to rescue Midna by giving her life force to her, and how she breaks the Twilight Mirror to prevent the Twilight from ever entering the world of light again, despite eluding to becoming very fond of Link.
4. Her character design is cool. I'm not sure what else to say about this aspect. Her appearance is unique and her broken helmet thing is very cool looking.

(Edit) 5. Midna's Lament. Thanks /u/cancerousiguana ​

Those are the reasons that I think Midna is the best sidekick.

(Edit) I'm not sure why but the post script I originally added saying Spirit Zelda was second best is missing. Anyways, ST Zelda is #2 best sidekick imo.",hot_subreddit,0,2019-04-07 11:10:57

Stupid bitch parks in front of my driveway and gets instant karma,3567,bamx57,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/bamx57/stupid_bitch_parks_in_front_of_my_driveway_and/,234,1554681621.0,"So there's a garage on the left hand side if my house where I park my car, and a driveway in front of it so the car can get inside. It's exactly like any other garage, and it is part of my property, yet some people feel that they're entitled enough to park just anywhere, including right in front of my fucking driveway.

EM = Entitled Mom Me = Me EC = Entitled child

It starts off when I'm about to go to the convenience store to get snacks, and I notice there's a car literally parked right smack in the middle of my driveway. There's no way my car could possibly get around, and I wasn't having any of it. So I yelled ""WHO THE FUCK OWNS THIS CAR"" and started blasting my horn. It took awhile for someone to finally react, and it just so happened to be the entitled bitch who owned the car. Apparently she was a mom of two kids, and she kept reminding me of that while I was arguing with her.

EM: WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAKING NOISE, MY KIDS ARE TRYING TO SLEEP!

Me: I apologize Miss, but some asshole decided it was a good idea to park right in front of my driveway.

EM: Yeah, that's my car, the spot I normally park in was taken by one of the neighbors and that was the only place I could park.

Now at first I actually felt sympathy for this woman. She had kids and everything and she wasn't wrong about the car taking up her spot because one of my other neighbors had a party celebrating their nieces Quincienera and the neighborhood was packed with cars, AND she didn't have a driveway of her own, so she had to park somewhere on the street. So I decided to calm down and nicely ask her to move her car, but instead of accepting my generosity, she decides to keep arguing with me.

EM: I am not moving my car, its late and I have to make sure my children get to bed.

Keep in mind it was only about 8:30 at the time, it wasn't late at all for her to move her car.

Me: I can't get my car out of here when your parked in the driveway, I'm asking you again to please move your car.

EM: What could you possibly be doing this late at night that requires you to drive somewhere???

Me: I'm just headed to the convenience store to get-

EM: I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING, YOU CAN WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW TO GET YOUR SHIT!

She was really getting on my nerves. I got ready to raise my voice but then I had an idea. So I reply with ""Okay."" and walk back inside my house. When I looked back I saw she had that ""Yeah, I totally showed him"" look on her face. I tried not to get pissed off at that as I reached for the phone and called the police. I explain the situation and a few minutes later a tow truck arrives.

The car was in fact illegally parked, and so it was impounded. The next day, early in the morning I get a knock on my door. Obviously it's the bitch mother. Her kids were standing next to her. She immediately starts yelling at me as soon as I open the door. Apparently she was going to take her kids to an amusement park, and now that they didn't have a car, there's practically no way for them to go. As soon as she tells me that I immediately chuckle, which pisses her off even more, meanwhile her kids are crying.

EC: Mommy! I really want to go!

Me being the insensitive asshole I point at the kid and let out a big ""HAH!"", which causes him to start screaming like a Banshee. The mom starts yelling at me saying how much of a monster I am, I just reply with ""Get a cab slut"" and slam the door in her face.

Anyone else wish that the official Harry Potter merchandise weren't so thoroughly based on the films?

Whenever I visit retail stores that I know will carry Harry Potter-related products (like Barnes & Noble), I always take a lap around the HP table just to get a quick HP fix for the day. Nowadays, everything is either some rendering of the actors, or it's a trinket in the ocean of junk that has exploded with the loosening of HP licensing (think of the Spongebob-esque clutter that you'll find on the discount table in the back of a Target or Walmart or something). I also live near the Universal Studios in Los Angeles, and every time I go to the shops in the Wizarding World section, I'm mostly underwhelmed by the sort of half-decent movie tie-ins that comprise all the stuff they sell at the stores.

OK, maybe this is just a roundabout way for me to say that I'm nostalgic about the pre-2000s stuff and want it to come back. At least there are some nice puzzles and posters with the Mary GrandPré illustrations still available.",hot_subreddit,0,2019-04-07 13:38:22

Was this some sort of early access feature that only alpha or beta players could get? Or are the devs just giving these out randomly? Regardless, I'm going to write a negative review in hopes that other people know what they're getting into before spawning.

We took turns at my sleepover trying to tell the scariest story we could. I think I won.,3422,bakgmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bakgmc/we_took_turns_at_my_sleepover_trying_to_tell_the/,94,1554667457.0,"George yawned and fidgeted on the carpet. The light from my bedside lamp caught his blonde hair and made it shine like a halo. He twirled a lock from his fringe around his index finger, let it snap back into place, then started twirling it again.

The kid looked bored. He'd obviously agreed to come round mine for a sleepover because I was new at school, and he wanted to see what kind of house I lived in. Get a sense of what I was like. But I could tell he was already regretting the decision.

""I thought you said you had a PS4?""

George's eyes flicked around the bedroom, as if he was hoping the console would magically appear from somewhere. We'd been upstairs since dinner. He'd explored my room and we'd chatted for a bit, then watched some random shows on Netflix. Things were going okay at first, but as the last light bled out of the day and the sky outside darkened, I could tell George was losing interest. That was when I suggested we do something a bit different.

""Nah, I don't have one,"" I said. ""Sorry. Are you still up for having a go at this game, though?""

""What, telling each other stories? Isn't that little kid stuff?""

George glanced at the watch on his wrist. I followed his gaze. George's watch was the first thing I noticed about him. He sits in front of me in English, and I spotted the watch after a ray of sunlight glinted off its face and caught my eye. It's a really nice watch. Most of the kids in my year have digital watches -- those blocky ones that light up when you press a button on the side -- but George's watch was different. More adult. It was one of the reasons I'd picked George to invite to over.

""Hey, can I try your watch on?""

George looked up at me and frowned. ""What?""

""Your watch. Can I try it on? It's really nice.""

George stared at me for a second longer. One hand moved to touch the strap on his wrist, as if to make sure it was still secure. ""Sorry, I don't let anyone try my watch on. My dad says I'm not allowed."" He glanced around the room once more, his eye going from the door to the dark window. He sighed. ""Okay, let's play this dumb game then. What do I have to do?""

Ignoring the bored look on his face, I smiled. ""It's really easy. We just take turns telling each other a scary story. Like, the scariest story you can possibly think of. Then whoever's is the scariest wins the game.""

George rolled his eyes. He stretched his long legs out in front of him. ""I don't know any scary stories. Besides, I think I might get some sleep soon. I'm pretty tired.""

""Come on, just one each. You must know at least *one* scary story. Everyone does. Plus, I know loads of good ones."" I watched George's face for a reaction. ""Unless you're one of those kids that frightens easily, that is. Then I guess you might not like the game.""

It was a risk, but George bit. ""I'm not scared of anything!"" The skin below his blonde hair creased into a frown. ""I've watched horror films with my big brother that are rated 18! We even found one on YouTube that's been banned and I *still* watched it.""

I didn't say anything. Just looked back at George and smiled. After a few seconds he let out another sigh. ""Fine, let's play your stupid game then. But after you're done done failing to scare me, that's it. I'm going to bed.""

\*

George went first.

His story wasn't bad, in fairness. It was one he said his uncle told him a couple of years back. Nothing I hadn't heard before. Basically there are two kids, and one of them gets hit by a car and dies. After the funeral, the mother gives the surviving kid some money to go and get liver from the store. Something to cook up for dinner. Because he's sick in the head, though, the kid pockets the money, digs up his brother, and removes *his* liver instead. Then later that night, the dead brother rises from his grave to come and get the kid in his sleep.

It's a decent enough story, but I'd heard it a hundred times already. I didn't let on, though. I made all the right faces, and jumped at the right parts. George got quite into it. He gestured his arms and his watch glinted in the light from my bedside lamp. His blonde hair spilled across his forehead. He was so into the story he didn't seem to notice.

After it was over he sat back, brushed the hair from his eyes, and grinned. ""I thought you were gonna shit yourself at one point,"" he said. ""You might as well give up now, anyway. I'm not scared of anything.""

I looked across the room at him. The house was quiet now, and had been for a few hours. When we'd first come upstairs there was still noise coming from below: the faint sound of the TV in the lounge; the rattle of plates being put away in the kitchen. Now there was only silence. Beyond the bedroom window, tree branches rustled in the wind. The occasional car passed by on the road outside. That was it. I grinned at George.

""So you're not scared of anything at all?

""Nope. Nothing.""

""Not even stories that are true?""

George let out a bark of laughter. ""Nice try. Just hurry up and get it over with, will you? I'm already bored.""

""Okay, fine."" I shuffled forwards on the carpet so I was sat closer to George. Our knees were almost touching. George frowned, but he didn't move.

""My story is about a family,"" I began. ""A family that looks normal enough on the outside, but isn't really normal at all.""

George rolled his eyes again. He was starting to annoy me quite a lot by now, but I didn't let on. I just carried on with the story as if I hadn't noticed.

""This family moves around a lot. They never stay in one place for too long. They can't, you see; the family's good at disguising themselves -- they're good at hiding their secret -- but they still can't go taking risks. If they stayed in one place for any more than a few weeks, they might get found out. Someone might discover what they really are.""

""So what are they then?""

I wanted to tell George not to interrupt -- to just sit still and listen to the story -- but I bit down the urge. Instead I just grinned at him.

""The family are monsters,"" I said. ""They're all monsters. They travel from town to town, and they leave a trail of dead kids wherever they go.""

I paused, expecting George to interrupt me again, but he didn't. He only stared back at me. There was no expression on his face as he twirled a lock of blonde hair round his finger.

""The family has a very specific way of doing things,"" I continued. ""When they move into a new area, they find a house that's been left unoccupied. Not a completely empty house -- just one where the people that normally live there are off on holiday or something. One that'll be empty for a week or two. The family doesn't need long, see. A couple of weeks suits them just fine.

""So they break into this house, and then they go about setting the trap. It's their own kid they use. They send him off to make friends in the neighbourhood. Round the nearby parks, maybe off to the local school under a fake name. Tell him to get to know the other kids. The family is hungry by this point -- really, *badly* hungry -- but they don't do anything just yet. They've learned to be patient.""

I paused and took a breath. This was a story I'd told before, but I found I liked it more and more with each retelling. The trick was not to rush, though. You had to savour it. 

I'd opened the bedroom window when we first came upstairs, and now a draught of cold air blew in. It ruffled the curtains behind George. Tree branches shook in the garden outside, the leaves whispering to each other. George watched me, not saying anything. I had his attention.

""The kid's parents don't have to wait long,"" I continued. ""They never do. They've trained the kid well, see? He's not just a victim in all this. He may only be young, but he knows how the game works. Once the family has been in the area for a little while -- a few days; maybe a week at most -- the kid makes his choice. He picks a new friend to invite back to their house. The parents give him an incentive, too. He's still too young to share the tastes they have -- they tell him that's something he'll only acquire when he gets older -- but he still gets *something* out of it.""

""What does he get out of it?"" George's eyes were fixed on mine. His finger kept twirling the same lock of hair, over and over again.

""He gets the other kid's stuff,"" I replied. ""Whoever he picks. He gets to keep all their belongings after his parents are finished with them.""

Somewhere in the house below us, a door slammed. George's eyes flicked away from mine towards the bedroom door, then back again. I smiled at him.

""So..."" George kept his eyes on me as he tried to formulate the question. ""So... what exactly do the parents... what do they do with the kids they take?""

""Oh, they eat them,"" I replied. ""They eat their insides. They tear the kids open while they're still screaming, and they pull out their guts and intestines by the handful. Wolf everything down until there's nothing left but a husk."" I grinned. Somewhere below us, a floorboard creaked. The sound was faint and muffled, and I don't think George heard it. ""Can you imagine what someone looks like when they've had everything inside them removed? They hardly even look like a person at all. It's like the stuff a snake leaves behind when it sheds its skin.""

The glow from the bedside lamp made George's skin look pale. His lips were slightly parted as he stared at me. ""But how do they get away with it?"" He asked. ""Don't the parents of the kids that get taken come looking for them the next day? When their kids don't show up back home?""

I grinned back at George. I'd been hoping he'd ask this. ""Oh, the family's long gone by that point,"" I said. ""They vanish like shadows in the night. The only thing they take with them is the remains of the dead kid. And when their parents come looking for them the next day, all they find is a locked house that belongs to somebody else.""

Another floorboard creaked. It was louder this time, and we both heard it. The sound had come from the corridor outside the bedroom. George's head swivelled in the direction of the door. His eyes were wide in his pale face. ""What was that?""

""Oh, that was nothing,"" I lied. ""Probably just the house settling. There's nothing to be scared of, George.""

I eyed the watch on his wrist. And imagined what it would look like on mine.

So I posted the video on an anonymous twitter with the girl's name and our school listed.

Anyway, everybody hated this girl already. She's a known psychopath. What I didn't realise is that the girl who took the video was a girl who is in a lot of my classes and has changed a lot since the video was taken and is no longer friends with the other girl (the video was taken about a year and a half ago). She is generally a very lovely and intelligent girl and I just think she was corrupted by the other girl for a short period of her life.

"For those of you who are currently tempted to binge, please read this.",1360,balbm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/balbm3/for_those_of_you_who_are_currently_tempted_to/,109,1554672268.0,"Don't do it. I just had a binge and ended up eating 3000 calories for the day, around 2000 of those were total junk and consumed in one go. I made the mistake of going too long without food, and I drank three single gins before my dinner so I was slightly tipsy. Prior to the binge I had eaten well today, I had prepared a healthy bean chilli in the slow cooker, I had entered all of my food/drinks (including the gins) into MFP.


I just lost it. I was so hungry and slightly tipsy so I absolutely wolfed my dinner down in under five minutes and then didn't feel satisfied. So I started on the oreos and ate the packet, then I had the Pringles, then the low calorie ice-cream, then cheese, then the coca cola.


I feel horrific. I couldn't stop, I knew what I was doing and didn't stop. It was like a frenzy, 'what else can I eat?!' and it didn't matter if it was sweet or savoury. I stood in the kitchen rather than just sitting down and taking a moment to be mindful. It mean I could get into the snacks faster. 

I'm having urges to go purge, something I haven't done in a very, very long time. My heart is thudding fast and heavy in my chest. I have heartburn and trapped wind. I have a stitch and my stomach is super swollen and puffy. I'm slightly out of breath. Mentally I feel like a total failure and so mad I slipped after getting back on track over the last few days.


The positives: I stopped. I actually firmly said 'enough!' in my head and I stopped. The will to binge was insane. I realise now that I just can't go that long without my dinner, I got too hungry. I logged all of my binge on MFP which is how I know I ate 3000 calories and I've noticed I'm eating an awful lot of carbs and snacks rather than balanced meals. I also realise I'm probably drinking too much alcohol at the moment and need to cut back.


Please, if you're thinking of binging, just take a second to think about it fully. Think of me sitting here feeling shame and regret at my lack of control. If you're like me and have serious relationship issues with food, consider help. I've been in therapy a while now and I'm going for a psychology assessment this week and I know I need it. I'm not ashamed of needing help.

If I help stop someone with this then that would make my evening better.",hot_subreddit,0,2019-04-07 16:24:28

2 years ago I learned how to code. It was difficult since I was behind in the lab due to my typing speed (12wpm). It was too slow, but that was the best I could reach at that moment.

The other exiting thing. English is not my first language. So at the same time I need to learn two languages at the same time: English and Python.

Now this is my last term. I am a better programmer now. If you are in the same age with me. Don't give up!

Anyway, I was on my bus ride home sitting down when an old man approached me. He looks at me and says “it would be nice of you to give that blind woman your seat” and points to a standing blind lady in, I’m saying her 40s.
I walk over to her, tap on her shoulder, and without thinking I say “there’s a spot for you over there” while pointing at the seat.
I pointed. At the seat. To show her where to sit.
She was blind.
She was confused as hell, and another woman kindly took her arm to lead her to the seat, but the woman was still confused and proceeded to stand.
The old man says “well you tried. Thanks for being kind.”
I know this isn’t the worst thing that could happen to me, but it was bad enough to make me feel like a fucking idiot.

So it’s prom season and furniture market and I bartend at a Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi bar so we’ve been pretty steady, we had a lot of young teenagers coming in all formally dressed, it’s prom season so it’s to be expected... anyways I hear one of the servers talking to our manger about how one of the guys in the group has an ID with his picture, and birthday, that looked to be 100% legit, I take the liquor laws seriously (because here in the Bible Belt they don’t play) so I asked the server if he wanted me to check the ID, I grab it and take it up front where we have a cop on the weekends (for our protection because our customers can get rude or try to walkout without paying on weekends) and had him shine his light on it and just run it to make sure it’s legit.... it’s a real legitimate license, so I take it back to the young man and go “I’m sorry sir, coming in with such a young group I want to make sure everyone has a fun and safe prom night” the whole table looks at me and laughs and one of the girls at the table looked at me and went “we’re here with a sorority for formal” 🤦🏻‍♀️ needless to say I broke a rule that night and gave him the “extra” beer I poured because the server and I were so embarrassed.

All the Demons and Demon Lords of Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes - 3D printed!,982,bak9zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/bak9zo/all_the_demons_and_demon_lords_of_mordenkainens/,58,1554666482.0,"[Here they are!](https://imgur.com/gallery/iDoVSNz)

In this next post I present to you all the Demons and Demon Lords from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes! The Letter D is a massive chapter in the book so I thought I'd show these off early for you all. These models really pushed some of my 3D modeling skills, especially the Sibriex, but I certainly had a lot of fun making them! The Demon Lords are a little dated in comparison given I made them three years ago when Out Of the Abyss came out, but I'm still pretty satisfied with how they look. 

I modeled these all in Blender, then printed them either in resin with my Anycubic Photon, or PLA with my Prusa i3 MK3. They were primed in black primer. I painted them them in acrylic paint, and used either a matte or gloss varnish to finish them off. 

In case you haven’t seen my works before, I've been 3D modeling and printing my own D&D minis for the past four years. I always share the files for free. Here are my galleries so far, with free access to the files under each image:

Figured instead of spending $50 for new lines I might as well spend $80 to bring everything up to date.

Granted it took me close to an hour in plumbing section [looking like this](https://media.giphy.com/media/3owzW5c1tPq63MPmWk/giphy.gif)  but I got it done. Small project really, replacing old-ass valves for washer and utility sink with something better looking and functioning.

Still far from ideal but still so much better. Now to reroute the sewer line and figure wtf to do with sump pit and all the extra space. Thinking of just 2-level plywood desk for laundry folding and ironing but more ideas are welcome.

So I found this subreddit on YT and just wanted to get this story out. This really does seem like one of the many fake ones and I want to clarify. This is not fake, however this did happen 2 years ago so not everything may be as exact as possible. I have a prosthetic arm due to a car crash when I was 10. I was walking around the grocery store to get some things for my mom when I saw this kid look at me oddly and whispered something to his mom. That is completely normal for me cause I have had the arm for 7 years. I went down another aisle to get some cereal for my sister when the mom comes walking in with the kid whimpering by her side. (In comes EM = Entitled Mom and EK = Entitled Kid)

Me: Hello, can I help you?

EM: Yes. My son was wondering if he could see your arm.

I just assumed he wanted to look at it so i just showed him it, not detaching it from my arm. Just assuming he wanted to look at it. 

EK: \*Grabs my arm and pulls on it\* 

BTW the arm is strapped on tightly so this hurt

Me: \*pulls away from his hand\*

Instantly the little kid starts crying

EM: He just wants to try it on.

This mom clearly doesn't know that you HAVE TO HAVE NO ARM to put it on.

I explain how I can't let him play with him because he could break it and it is a PAIN to get the one I have. 

EM: Let my son play with it! He is extremely careful.

I am getting extremely pissed off and while I tell her he can't play with it for a 3rd time, she tried to rip it off! I was using my actual hand to pry her grip off and while this is happening, 3 people are watching. She continues to pull it until two of the fingers (pointer and middle). She just stands there for like 10 seconds when 2 employees run in and check out the situation. When the employees ran in, she and her son bolted, still holding the fingers. I then finish checking out and go to my mom. While we were talking in the car, we saw the mom and kid walking on the sidewalk. I tell my mom to stop the car and I run over to her, snatch the fingers from the kids hands, and quickly take out my phone and take a photo of the mother. She screams at me calling me a peice of shit, spoiled brat, etc. We then went home and reattached the fingers. The moral of this story is to treat the handicapped limbs, wheelchairs, etc. with respect. They are not just things but extensions to us handicapped. ",hot_subreddit,0,2019-04-07 18:41:29

In the first split of the teams inception they make finals with meteos as one of their main big players. Summer split they are doing incredibly then they choose to kick meteos and there team falls to pieces.

This is not the first time this has happened with Meteos. This also happend with P1 where in the spring split they got 3rd place even when Meteos was last minute signed to the team. After Meteos left the team they went from 3rd to dead last with a 4-14. To make this even worse this was when the NA LCS was incredibly weak with teams such as Envy, Old TL, Old Echo Fox and Old Flyquest.

Truly Meteos is a incredibly undervalued player and he should be considered a high priority player to pick up for teams looking for a new jungler.",hot_subreddit,0,2019-04-07 18:19:24

It was a beautiful ceremony, however I did find some things strange. For instance, the priest never said, ""You may now kiss the bride"", but I just assumed it was purely an American thing and didn't mind.

Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.

As we passed, they all said in unison, ""You may now kiss the bride!"" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.

As we walked away I asked, ""Why did *they* tell us to kiss and not the priest?""

My wife answered,

He died in my ear,1826,bahwt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/bahwt8/he_died_in_my_ear/,71,1554653842.0,"I want to start by saying this happened a year ago. It was the reason I didn't renew my last contract and I am honestly still carrying it. So I'm here to let this out.

I was working from home for a roadside assistance hotline. I liked the job. Helping people in my pajamas was **exactly** where I wanted to be in my career path. I was really good at it. My metrics were stellar; I had a nice collection of 5 star reviews and enough experience with crazy calls to be confident about my handiwork.


-pleeeeeep!-

""Thank you for calling *Company*! Are you in a safe location?""

I get a range of reactions to this. Nine times out ten, even if people are parked in the middle of an active volcano they will say yes to this question or they will just ignore that I asked it. *Are you in a safe location?* even gets it's share of scoffing from elderly people who don't appreciate having their wellbeing questioned. My point is, people are usually all right enough for the question to feel superfluous to them. I still asked at the beginning of every call. 

""No, I'm not."" Hit me like a frisbee to the face. 

I didn't freeze, I asked questions to find out what his situation was. By this point I'd been on hat through several big Noreasters, I knew what to do.

The Caller had been out of town for business and he had been struck by another vehicle and the people that ran him off the road had fled the scene. He told me that his cell phone was redirecting his 911 call back to his home town and he needed emergency assistance. He said he had an injury, but that it wasn't life threatening. His words. His description of the situation. I'm all ears and no eyes so I move forward with trying to help. 

I had to find him. He was on a long back road in a town he'd never been to with zero road names/landmarks visible. So it took me a second to find what city/county he was in so I could get the right emergency services to him. Basic protocol that I've trained for. 

I get 911 on the line. I tell them where he is, patch him in and they said that due to conditions and his location that it's going to be 10-15 minutes. He says, ""No problem."" 

Then the 911 operator hopped of the line. That didn't make sense to me AT ALL. I stayed on the line with him. He kept apologising to me so I told him that getting help to him was my greatest priority and that I wouldn't leave him until I knew he was safe. I told him that he mattered to me. 

I still dream about the next part.

He told me that he appreciated me and he began telling me his war stories. He'd been in the military and seen fire fights. Lost friends. 

He told me ""this injury"" was nothing compared to using his knife to pull shrapnel out of his own leg while his best friends died around him when their convoy was ambushed. He told me that he wouldn't let himself be discharged after the leg injury. That he was back in the field as soon as he could be. He talked about his buddies that died next to him.

He told me a couple of stories like that about his tours.  

Through his stories he had been progressively sounding worse. His voice went from clear to Tired and slurred. He told me that he missed his friends since he'd been home. 

Then he thanked me for ""being so nice"" and listening to him. He said I was a really nice woman and that he was really glad I was the one that took his call. 

At the 18 minute mark I heard that noise that you get on the phone when someone exhales in the receiver. Then quiet. I thought that maybe he had passed out.  

I stayed on the line, calling his name, for 3 more agonizingly long minutes before I heard someone approach. First responders had arrived. 

I talked to the police who arrived first. They said he was unresponsive and asked if I knew what had happened. I had a description of what had happened and I had the description of the car that had hit him. While I was giving information the officer had to ask me to pause. In the pause he spoke with other first responders then radioed a request for a medical examiner. 

I held it together. I gave them the rest of my collected information and I gathered the police information that I needed for a vehicle recovery report. I finished and ended the call. Documented the call in call logger and put myself back into the que.

In the US they will now require food labels to list Added Sugars on all food products. Something that will hopefully help people make better decisions. 

Also the serving sizes of food product labels is being increased. This one always seemed dubious. Sometimes you would see a product saying it only had 3 grams of fat or something but the serving size would be something extremely low. So now the serving sizes will have to be larger and more reasonable.

These changes on the nutrition facts label will take place over the next year or 2 for all products and some have already made changes to their labels.

Met a gorgeous woman off of Tinder. We hit it off great. We both frequent the same small town coffee shop. We both enjoy video games, art, music, and have similar tastes in these things. Got her number after running into her at the coffee shop post-match.


 We had a date last night. Went out bowling and brought her back to my place to make dinner for her. Had a late dinner. Smoked some dabs. Drank some whiskey. Watched parks and rec while playing the drinking game for it. 10/10 would recommend. It was great. At some point throughout the night she tries hogging the couch which leads to cuddling, kissing, etc. I lead her to the bedroom and strip her down and do my part. We cuddled and she starts getting handsy and asking for the business. Obviously I's gone give it to her. I'm good for it and pretty drunk. We'd polished half a bottle of whiskey between us. And then I whisper in her ear the cringiest thing to ever pass my lips.

""U want sum fuk?""

Absolutely fucking lost it. Both of us immediately laughing like the world is ending. 0/10, not a sexy phrase to get your ladies in the mood.

Feeling Pretty Beat Down Today,1,baq4tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/baq4tn/feeling_pretty_beat_down_today/,0,1554703320.0,"This was the week from hell.

I'm currently attending one of the Lard's universities. I've had an irrational fear of the HCO for many moons now so I've been pretty careful. When the HC stories dropped on Tuesday night, I read every one, and now my stress is dialed up to 11. My honest hope is their office is so inundated with public outcry that they don't have the time or resources to ruin my life or the lives of my fellow students. On Thursday, I caught a bitch of a cold and I just feel like I'm running on fumes. I have finals coming up and this whole month is just turning out to be a shitshow. 

I watched almost every conference talk this weekend. For most of it, I had a blast on the exmo discussion pages. It's the most conference fun I've had in my whole life. So I was actually in pretty good spirits until Nelson's talk this morning. Jesus H. Christ. I'm still trying to figure out why it hurt so bad. I don't feel guilty about my choices and I don't feel compelled to join the fold again. But holding families hostage like that? I just feel sick. It preyed on my family's exact insecurities. You see, my parents are obsessed with the millennium. They're constantly foregoing enjoyment and even routine medical treatment because everything will be perfect in the millennium. No cost in this life is too great for them when you consider what's on the other side of the veil. When I talked with them, they gushed about how wonderful the talks were today. It just drained what little emotional energy I had left.

The church has curb-stomped me at every turn, and it's taken me a long time to recognize its abusive influence in my life. It has made me feel worthless and inadequate. But I'm finally in a place where I'm happy with who I am. I haven't done anything wrong that would cut me off from my family. I know that. I don’t even believe in an afterlife. But damn. If the church were true, shouldn't Nelson be the most Christlike human alive? Yet he has the gall to say ""thankfully, I'm not this man's judge."" Nelson would cut off a sincere man from his departed wife for eternity because he refused to pay 10% of his income so the GAs can go on lavish vacations to Rome, build decadent temples all over the world, and receive a modest stipend at least double the median U.S. household income. Fuck me, then. 

I've never really considered resignation before. I know it would break my parents' hearts. But I can't live with this yoke on my neck. I know that's a positive metaphor in the church; we're yoked with Christ but he does the heavy lifting. I don't feel that. I've done all the heavy lifting and I don't have any strength left. Yokes are for beasts of burden, designed to carry out the work of whip-wielding taskmasters (See, Rasband/Holland? I too can use alliteration you sonsofbitches). If I keep this thing on any longer, I'll suffocate. Once I'm all finished with school, I think it will be time to break the yoke for good.",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 01:02:00

Feeling a bit lost and a bit hopeless,1,baq4sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/baq4sb/feeling_a_bit_lost_and_a_bit_hopeless/,0,1554703313.0," 

Hello everyone;

When I was five years old, I fell out of a tree and broke both my wrists and had a greenstick break in my right radius. When I was about 12 or 13, I had persistent wrist pains. The orthopedic surgeon I had been referred to when I was 5 determined I had a ligament tear in the right wrist and I had surgery to correct it. A few years later I had a ligament tear corrected in the left wrist.  A few more years go by and I had another set of surgeries. I was around 22 (which is apparently when bones stop growing) when the same surgeon explained that my ulna and radius had grown to the same length, in both arms, which caused them to hit each other and erode when I turned my wrist/arms. I had what was called an ulna shortening (again on both arms), to “fix” the issue, which was removing about 3-5 mm of the ulna in the arm and plating over it. A few more years passed, and I had a lot of pain and nerve damage and the plates had to be removed.

I’m 31 now and back in February and experienced more-than-usual pain at the gym. I was placed in an arm hinge-brace and a wrist brace (and still am in both). However, I found out that I had fractured the right wrist and went to a new orthopedic surgeon at a well-known hospital. He was concerned and ordered an MRI and we found that I have very, very little cartilage and “cushion” between my carpals and bones and that I had at least three different ligament tears. Further, the top of my ulna and radius have deteriorated. My surgeon literally walked into the room, looked at me, and said: “Your wrists are a mess.” It is assumed that the left wrist is pretty comparable to the right.

I’m scheduled for another surgery at the beginning of May to scope the wrist to get a better look at the damage and to flush out some of the...well...crap that is causing a lot of pain in my wrist. I am scheduled in the fall for another scope. The surgeon wants to do a complete wrist replacement in both wrists, but we have not set a date yet given my age as well as wanting to see the extent of the damage when he goes in.

I have learned to live with constant pain but the lack of mobility is really slowing me down. I am a writer/communications manager/editor for work (self-employed) and I depend heavily on my wrists for work. I suspect I will lose even more mobility as time goes on and I suspect that the wrist replacement surgeries will make it nearly impossible to turn my wrists in any “normal” fashion. 

Part of this post was that I really just needed to vent to a community that might understand how I’m feeling. Part of this post is asking what the hell I do now. I’m an American, and am self-employed. Is there any way I qualify as “disabled” if both my wrists are injured to the point where it is difficult to not only work but complete day-to-day tasks (buttons, doors, and keys are the worst!) I have never felt more hopeless. I want to get things done and now I can’t even carry a damn gallon of milk.",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 01:01:53

Fear in Buddhism,1,baq4rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/baq4rs/fear_in_buddhism/,0,1554703309.0,"I've been told that culturally speaking, Buddhism in China has tended to inculcate an inordinate amount of fear in the ordinary masses on account of unfavorable rebirths in hell, or something like that. Can anyone give me more resources that talk about that? Examples of Chinese Buddhist ""sermons""/writings that would seem to arouse inordinate amounts of fear? It doesn't even necessarily need to be specific to Buddhism in China. It could from any tradition/country. I'm interested in comparing this facet of Buddhism with the comparable teachings and sermons in Christianity of fear of hell and sin during the middle ages, and see how these sorts of things could develop the way did.",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 01:01:49

Any ideas? Please keep reading for details 😊

I have three cats—all rescues, two of whom were homeless strays in a big city before my SO and I took them in. One of them—Roger—has a bit of a distended belly.

Unfortunately, due to health issues, I’m on Disability and can barely afford utilities at the moment. (It’s temporary, and my cats are my babies, so I’m never giving them up. I’d rather sell my organs. So please don’t recommend this.)

There’s a clinic nearby, but they only do routine wellness visits and spay/neuter. Roger needs to get tests done to see what’s going on with his belly. It’s been swollen for a little while—it doesn’t seem to hurt him. But we need to get him checked out ASAP.

I can’t use CareCredit, I already owe them a lot of money. My credit is bad, I can’t get a credit card. 

Any ideas??? I might write to the Letters Foundation. I’m trying to do some art commissions here and there and doing surveys online, but it’s so slow-going. Iggfhhhhhhbsns. Any advice is welcome. Thanks for reading!!",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 01:01:40

It’s level with my nipple basically but towards the left so it shows if I wear anything super low cut. I had the longest journey of feeling insecure over this scar. It was mistaken as a hickey a lot and I was embarrassed of it for that reason. I’ve grown up a lot and I feel comfortable with my scar. But I don’t love it.

I was at work today and a coworker that I only talked to once or twice came up to me and told me that I look like I lost weight! This is kind of a two in one with some of my other victories.  I've only started a couple weeks ago and I actually wasn't expecting one so soon, but it made my entire night. Lately, because of going to the gym, I've met a couple co-workers who honestly have been the best with support and helping me get started. I've dropped soda/juice for water, dropped junk food, gym 4-5x a week and have been doing CICO on top of seeing a personal trainer who is wonderful to work with. I always thought personal trainers were a rip off, but I can see why some people need them now. She is kind, understanding and so supportive to help me crush my goals. This has affected my emotional state and confidence deeply. I feel so much happier, free and with so much energy. My other friend has also supported me by attending classes with me and pushing me; she has gone through her own transformation which was so inspiring because she had no one like that when she was going through it. So, I feel that she is selfless by being there for me even though when she did it, that she had no one. I did a double circuit with her for the first time on Saturday and we both just cried together in the car, crying because I was so happy to have a friend like her and helping me achieve what I have always wanted. This is so much hard work and even just hearing that small compliment just added to my drive to succeed in this. I am currently 244 lbs and my goal is 175 next March. I hope my small story can help inspire others as it inspires myself. Thank you reddit for listening to my story and when the time comes, I wanna show this wonderful community my progress pictures.

Can someone help me do the math?

However, my problem is more-so that I was too lazy to actually do the 5th section of the test because it was only a 3rd logical reasoning section so I just submitted the test early... (oops, turns out it was the graded one that I didn’t complete)

So I just pretended the one I took was the graded one to try and figure out what my score was 

I got 72/100 correct when I did that, is there a way to find my LSAT practice score based on that... and is it even accurate or not at all? I’m kinda sad because I don’t know what I got and I feel like my grade isn’t accurate I guess I learned my lesson

What I'm looking for in a relationship is something real. That's probably something that most guys post on here but I really mean it. I want a relationship where I feel like I can have fun with the person and also talk about things that are more thought provoking and serious. I want a relationship that can be long term. I'm not sure what else to say. I'm bad at this but I definetly open up more once you get to know me better and I am definitely less... Awkward.

(I'm a bot)
*****
> The Yellow Vest movement doesn&#039;t need much introduction at this point, but for those who wish to have their memory refreshed: In November of last year, thousands of people in major French cities protested the planned increase in fuel duties, which the government introduced in order to keep promises made under the 2015 Paris Climate Accord.

> The protests then mutated into larger demands for social justice, but due to their apolitical nature and lack of leaders beyond those who coordinate the logistics of the protests, there are multiple, occasionally contradictory calls to action.

> Leray&#039;s comments were met with outrage; the government soon replied that soldiers were only in the city to defend against terrorism and that no soldier would come into contact with a yellow vest protester.

> Deploying the military and rebranding protesters as terrorists is only the latest example of the degradation of civil liberties by this French government.

> In a FEE article from the beginning of February, I explained the new &quot;Anti-troublemakers law,&quot; which gives law enforcement the right to search all protesters without reasonable suspicion, levies a &euro;15,000 fine on people covering their face, and gives prefects the right to impose bans at their own discretion on an individual&#039;s right to protest.

> Ironically, an initial call opposing government intervention in one aspect of the population&#039;s lives has resulted in greater intrusion in the area of the protesters&#039; civil liberties.

Spent $600 in a month on crap without noticing. Back down to a few hundred in my bank account with a month left of school. How did I let it get this bad? How do I stop?,1,baq4l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/baq4l7/spent_600_in_a_month_on_crap_without_noticing/,0,1554703273.0,"Hello moms and pops. I feel really dumb right now. I spent a lot of money in not a lot of time, and now I'm wishing I was smarter about it.

My mother graciously let me keep my refunded $900 tuition from a dropped class in February. I had been struggling with money until then, I had less than 100 dollars in my account. (For me, ""struggling"" means pushing on uncomfortable. I usually keep a few hundred in my bank account as cushion. If it helps further my point, I don't actually know how far my car will take me on an empty tank because I never let it get below 1/4 tank. I'm a very ""always have a backup"" kind of person.)

Anyways, somehow I guess I got used to having money to blow again (I had a few thousand first semester), and that's exactly what I did. I thought that fast food for dinner and buying a Coke on my way to class was just a bit of a splurge, but I looked today and I spent around $450 on all that alone. The other hundred or so was large purchases on things I needed (but weren't necessities my parents would pay for).

I can't believe how badly I blew it, and this money is supposed to last me until I move back home (and probably for the whole summer, if we're honest). My parents will obviously help me, and support my living costs like usual, but I can't get over how much money I LOST by being so irresponsible.

I'm thankful to have real life parents that always pay for my cost of bare living, but, internet parents- how do I avoid messing up this bad with my ""spending cash"" again??",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 01:01:13

Anyone in the area interested in fostering or adopting a cute one eye'd cat?,1,baq4kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/baq4kv/anyone_in_the_area_interested_in_fostering_or/,0,1554703271.0,"[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/1pyySRN)

Ah guys, I'm in a dilemma. I posted about a grey cat back in October. I was trying to find a foster or home for. She was wondering around in a patch of woods around my apartment for about 8 months. I was finally able to catch her. I got in contact with sweet dreams rescue, and they took her and got her eye removed (her eye was really bad messed up).

2 months ago FIVE months after giving her to Sweet dreams rescue I checked in on her - they still weren't able to find her a home (she's been in a cage the whole time they've had her), they said she does not show well at adoption events ;( My heart broke! The couple days I had this cat I fell in love with her. After pleading with my brother to foster her I picked her up from sweet dreams rescue and thought my brother would end up keeping her.

My brother unfortunately decided he was not a cat person. Mainly just cat hair and the very small responsibility that comes with them. Nothing wrong with Timber, she's very well behaved. I've argued with him to PLEASE keep her. He wont, :( So now I currently have her.

I was considering fostering Timber however I have 2 cats in a VERY small 1 bedroom apartment. It's really difficult with the ones I have but I refuse to send her back to be locked in a cage until she gets adopted. She's not being taken to adoption events due to not showing well. I feel she'll never get a home :(

Would anyone be willing to foster or adopt her? She's a very very sweet cat and loves being petted and she purrs a lot, although it does take her a bit of time to adjust. She's not a huge fan on being held. I don't think she'd do well with children or other pets, but if you have pets and would be willing to do a proper introduction (crate or room method) she would probably be just fine! Also she is now an INSIDE cat. She does like doing her own thing, she's really not much work and does not scratch furniture. If things don't work out for some reason you can bring her back to me. But please I hope someone considers adopting this baby or at foster her!",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 01:01:11

Quick reference for users having their Pokémon checked:

When another user offers to check eggs for you, they will most likely tell you which method they will be using. Below is a list of the common methods, and instructions on what to do for each.

* TEA method: The checker will initiate a trade with you ingame. Show the Pokémon you want checked on the screen. Do not offer or trade the Pokémon - it only needs to be visible on the trade screen. If you are having multiple Pokémon checked, show each one for a couple seconds, and then quickly move on to the others. *The checker may use nicknamed Pokémon as signs to let you know when they are ready for you to begin showing Pokémon.*
* Battle video (BV) method: The checker will challenge you to a battle ingame. Bring the Pokémon you want checked, and be sure to enter them into the actual battle. Forfeit the battle immediately.
 - If the Pokémon being checked are eggs, disable autosave (important), and then hatch them. Then reset your game after the battle.
* Trade method: Trade your Pokémon/eggs to the checker. They will read their information and then trade them back to you.",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 01:01:07

Drugs,1,baq4iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/baq4iw/drugs/,0,1554703259.0,"So I just watched Beautiful boy (really good), and it has kind of made me wonder. In that you hear things about the gay lifestyle, with partying and that drugs are a big part of that (like with bathhouses and that stuff). I mean I guess you could say this is youth culture regardless. To experiment with drugs.

My thoughts are because I have past issues with addiction. While not drug related. I guess it would be called online gambling. But I lost a year of my life and blew over 10 grand and failed college miserably. Super surprised I never ended up killing myself either because I hit right rock bottom. Didn't even over come it. My drug of choice ( as I'll call it) just self imploded on itself that it wasn't even impossible to go back to it. (think cocaine being replaced with 99% salt. 

So I am here two years later. I am far better. But that feeling is still there. I still miss the feelings I had while using it (not a drug I'll just call it that) even today. And if I had the choice of going back and choosing not to I can't really say for certain I would. And after watching the movie and one of the themes is that the drug isn't the problem it's the black hole in soul and you are just using to try to cure that. Which hit me that it's completely true for me. I definitely had and even still do have a black hole. While it's not as bad as before it is still there. 

My question is in relation to dating others and being gay I have read and have certain ideas that it may often involve drugs. (Tell me if I am incorrect here). Notably my city has drug issues too. Like most people my age have done atleast cocaine. So don't know if is like that everywhere. That how do you not allow yourself to be put in situations that may pressure you to partake in drugs? 

I am not saying if I see a drug I will jump to it. But. Depending on my mood I can't say for certain I wouldn't cave to peer pressure. And I know, I just know that if I take a drug that makes you feel better that I won't be the same after.

Upgrading one PC ($600) and using the salvaged parts to build another ($300),1,baq4i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/baq4i8/upgrading_one_pc_600_and_using_the_salvaged_parts/,0,1554703254.0,"Hey, everyone. I'm looking to upgrade my PC, and I would like to salvage the old parts to build a separate PC for my fiancee. The goal is for mine (""**Computer 1**"") to run games that are ~3-4 years old at the best settings that are realistic in my price range (about $600). Also, I plan to move up to 144hz monitors (1080p) in the near future so it would be great to take advantage of that. For hers (""**Computer 2**""), the most demanding task will be to run the games that we play co-op together -- think Age of Empires or Stardew Valley.

Here is my current setup. Other than the storage, case, and PSU, I feel like everything could bear to be replaced?

>**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

The most demanding use for Computer 1 is gaming, but I don't usually play the brand-new, AAA stuff. The highest-end for now is probably, for example, Dark Souls 3, Titanfall 2, or modded Skyrim. I plan to move to 144hz monitors at 1080p.

Computer 2 is much more modest because it won't have to do anything much tougher than run Stardew Valley. Mainly, I just want new parts that will play nice with whatever parts I salvage from Computer 1.

>**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

Approximately $600 for Computer 1, $300 for Computer 2.

>**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Immediately.

>**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

All peripherals, including monitors, are taken care of. Computer 2 will need an OS, and I know buying Windows will take a big bite out of the budget -- I'm not aware of whether there are workable alternatives but welcome any tips.

>**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

New Jersey, USA. There's a Micro Center nearby.

>**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

(see above)

>**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

I've never done it and it's not part of the plan, but I'm open-minded.

>**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

For Computer 2, hope to have an SSD spacious enough to run the OS and maybe some frequently used programs.

>**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

No preference.

>**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

As noted above, Computer 2 will need an OS.",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 01:00:54

*4) The themes (action, slice of life etc), genres (modern, fantasy etc) and types of rps (plot, character, world building centered) vary depending on your current cravings.*

*5) You prefer to find one perfectly matching partner to rp various stories with for years than change partners whenever you feel like different character/setting/theme etc.*

**In the pre-dawn hours of April 8, 2018, I was surfing the net for a good movie before bed. I came across the listing for ""Call Me By Your Name."" Oh wow, I thought! I had seen the trailers for this film and was blown away by them. This was the first movie in ages I wanted to see. The trailer was so filled with sunlight and reflections of summer. You almost wanted to be in that tarn also.**  


**CMBYN awakens all your senses. I have always said it's not for one group of people, but for every group. As a straight woman I grew up trying to respect all people's choices that didn't hinge on the unlawful. I had no ill-will towards gay people of either sex. I just didn't know the depth of their convictions to each other, until I saw ""Brokeback Mountain.""  That film enlightened me about same sex lovers. They were no different than me and my husband. So when I saw the ads for CMBYN, it was a movie I was very eager to see. The ads made you, as I said, want to be a part of it. And a part of it I became.**  


**So I began to honker down and watch the movie. From that clunky car pulling up to that end credits I was locked in on the beauty of the scenery, the music, the cast, the wardrobe... everything was so authentic. Admittedly I had to work into the slow burn, but Elio quickly grabbed my attention. Very adeptly played by Tim Chalamet, it was as if Chalamet was looking for answer himself. It became hard to separate the character from the actor. Chalamet did so many things that someone falling in love or even crushing would do. I loved, loved, his anxiety and the characterizations he brought to it.** 

**Andre Aciman did a masterful job of leading Elio in his dreams to go all out with his desires. I thought it quite honest the things manic Elio did. He was on a search to find himself. If he couldn't be honest then, when?**   


**I must admit I would have loved to have seen more of Oliver's past talked about with Elio. Didn't happen... moving on. First watch I was with them until that phone call. OMGosh I couldn't detest Oliver more. I mean, have you ever had to call you parents to come give you a hug? I could have throttled Oliver. When the final five or 6 minutes came in...  that was it! I was done with Oliver. My life flashed in front of me like it was on the Jumbotron. I didn't know if I was hurting more for Elio or me. The second viewing I went in with some knowledge and a more open mind. So I relented towards Oliver and actually felt sorry for him. Life!**

**\*\*Please note that I had seen nor read anything about this film other than the trailers for it months earlier. And I had forgotten about the movie as I knew I wouldn't see it in a theater.**  


**The completeness of the movie didn't unfold until weeks later with the reading of the book. or the Audio of it.  Elio takes one back to what you do for love or a crush when you're young. I sent my boyfriend in High school a full letter in Morse Code.  :) Young and stupid... but so in love. This movie made me hate Oliver then the next viewing I saw him differently and I empathized with him. However, Elio and that close. I still can't watch; and if it sneaks in during a video, I find myself comforting Elio and brushing away his tears.  Just heart-breaking.**  


**I hope to celebrate my anniversary with CMBYN tonight around the same time and try to watch the entire movie. Even the scenes that break your heart.  Like Oliver's expression the morning after when Elio doesn't want his touch.**  


**CMBYN unlike Brokeback, takes you to another place. I never had a desire to relive my lost love because of it, or to deal with current love because of it as I do CMBYN. The movie opens you up like a can of sardines. It just peels back your skin and exposes everything. Things you want to forget, but can't. Things you want, but can't have.**   


**""Call Me By Your Name"" was like $250 an hour couch session.  It still is. I feel if I let go, I'll lose something or someone precious to me. The film is timeless.   \_\_Lllater  :)**",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 01:00:42

24 [M4F] Montreal - Friendship and maybe more.,1,baq4fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/baq4fp/24_m4f_montreal_friendship_and_maybe_more/,0,1554703238.0,"Hi there,  


I'm a 24 yo student who is currently study visual arts in Montreal and I thought I'd give this reddit r4r thing a shot to see if I could make new friends or maybe even more if things work out.  


To start, I'll give a bit of information about me.   


Physically, I'm white, 5'10'' (Or 5'11''? Every time I get measured, it changes so I don't know anymore), healthy weight, brown hair, brown eyes. I've lived half of my life in the United States before returning to Québec for my studies. I enjoy art, animation, listening to music, video-games, computers and hiking/climbing/swimming whenever I get the chance. Personality-wise, I am shy when meeting someone for the first time or when surrounded by a lot of people but once I've got the chance to know a person I become fairly outgoing. I do crude and sarcastic jokes and I don't restrain what comes out of my mouth, so be aware of that.  


When it comes to what I'm looking for in a friend, honestly just someone nice and open minded. By open minded, I do mean expect opposing view from me as I love dissecting topics. Though if we're talking about a romantic relationship, I do look at how I connect with a person and I expect the person to be relatively healthy. I do have a personal preference to certain physical traits though the personality of a person is what makes the strongest lasting impression and connection.  


I don't share pictures on posts here. I'd rather get to talk to someone first on programs like discord first before sending anything.  


Thanks for reading my post and I wish you all a good day.",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 01:00:38

Basically, I want to transfer my tablet area from my XP Pen drivers to the Hawku drivers, but the measurements (?) of the XP Pen drivers is **completely** different from the Hawku drivers.

Is there a way to translate the measurements from the XP Pen drivers to the Hawku drivers?

Measurements: X: 37 | Y: 115 | W: 260 | H: 171

Haven't seen any other posts/videos about this situation :P.

p.s if i don't respond sooner or later i might be sleeping :p its 11. ",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 01:00:28

Even if we had to beat lower waves to unlock the higher ones, it would probably get me to play a lot more.  

Combats fantastic, but it doesn't seem to get me playing more then a couple of times a week for half a hour or so when theres nothing to really work towards.  

Losing has no real impact because theres no consequence, I'd love that thrill of unlocking that last wave at the last minute, or almost getting there and failing.

I really like her and I want to be with her I’m just afraid it won’t be possible in the long run. So do you think I should give this a shot or should I call it off to avoid her pain/wasting her time?

But nothing has ever quite scratched the itch like the good old days. I've picked up a couple systems (DCC and LotFP) with the intent of grabbing a few more (LL, OS Essentials, Knave, White Hack) in the near future.

But, I've never DM'd and I think it's time to take a stab at it. So, like the post title says, what's a great dungeon (or 5 or 6) for me to get my feet wet with? I've seen a lot of posts for what systems to run as beginning players,  but I don't see much in the way of what dungeons are good for the starting DM. I watched Questing Beasts video on Tomb of the Serpent King, but that seems more for beginning players? Though I'm definitely picking it up 'cause that price can't be beat. I've also thought about In Search of the Unknown as an option.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I can't tell you how excited I am to relive the 80s and the best era of RPGs.

Picked up Norsca on N/N and roflstomped everyone from turn 2, 100k, 3 stacks with silver-gold units in late game. Only Monster Hunts were challenging.

Then started few Empire campaigns again on H/H and couldnt even continue after gathering 1st province, orcs from west and beastmen simply come and raze all small cities in 2 turns and leave and I cant be in 3 places at once. 

Question is what are the best difficulty settings? Normal too easy so it is boring, hard for now is unforgiving after 30 turn.

My father died about a year ago and he had left a gigantic about of money behind ( 1m+ ) and based on research I did for many many hours through multiple sources which include government websites, the money is supposed to go to me. Although he didn't have a will the money is supposed to go to me as I am the first person in line to inherit the money because I am his child. So, my grandmother decided that she would take all the paintings my father had and sell them for 100's of thousands of dollars and also take his bank money (which I have no idea how she did as the account is supposed to stay closed until I turn of age). She knows of our family's financial situation and that we couldn't really do much because we don't even have a lawyer yet. Im not sure if it would be good or bad for me to sue her as it would practically destroy my family relashionship which his side. Although I'm not close to my father's family I don't want to risk it.

Man it feels weird to say that. Currently working at Subway part time right now, and once I graduate my play is to start working at a UPS store @ $10/h so I can move out. But past that... I have no plans at all.

I've never done well in school, it's been a journey I won't even get into just to get my diploma. I'm on the spectrum, I have a lot of extreme anxiety and social problems that kicked my ass in my freshmen/sophomore years. I have mostly got it under control but it's definitely still something I struggle with. It makes me worried about going into college, let alone having not a clue what degree to get.

I've looked into a few careers, like being an electrician, accountant, or a mail delivery driver. But I can't figure out exactly *what* I want from a job. I know from subway and other fast food jobs I don't want to be interacting with customers constantly. I barely talk to my coworkers even, I have to force myself to do my job when I work the front line. 

I know I definitely want a career with a high salary. That's why I originally looked into being an electrician, as here they make close to $70k/y after finishing the IBEW 5-year apprenticeship. There's a couple reasons I'm hesitant about that in particular though. First, I know jack shit about electrical work, and to get the apprenticeship I'd have to move a couple hours away to be in the right local. It's a big commitment to move and go into a 5-year apprenticeship for something I know nothing about or know if I'd be okay with the physical labor and type of work it is.

But... That's it. Really the only things I'm into is music & gaming. I know a bit about computers, and see it recommended a lot here, but I know just as much as your average Reddit user. My dad is a programmer, and I know that would definitely not be a good fit.

Alright guys and gals and what ever else you may identify as, lol... This is mainly Trek in general related but is part of Discovery so first off let me give you background on my Trek lore knowledge and know how ok...

I am gonna be 35 come july 4th this year, I have been watching Trek since the premiere of TNG and was ALWAYs there for next weeks episode for every Trek that followed then I wanted to learn their roots and where it all began so I watched TOS, and have every movie some was able to see in on the big screen some not... still Trek to me is a big big part of my life as we all have had good times and bad but one constant was always there other then direct family or the odd friend but it was Trek either new episode or rerun it was always there... see I have a huge problem something that I am jealous of all you core fans or kelvin fans or any kind of fan new or old it's part of what is wrong with me as a whole it is what the y ""memory retention"" not 110% sure what its about or the severity of it but it blows cause I see soooo many post among so many trek groups that I wanna comment on or a debate to take part of and I cant cause I cant like you guys at times recall even the smallest detail of something at times or like something that bleeds over to one of the other series or something in one of the movies that is a cool call back to an old episode or 2... that said i'm not saying that I dont know my trek cause I do its more so that when I hit the memory recall button my brain acts like a stoner and is all like "" nah, man I dun wanna move today"" so sorry for the french but it F\*n sucks, but with this post I will post pics of my collection not only to prove I know my shit but also to show yeahs that I grew up on Trek border lined obsessive almost like when Stewie kidnapped the TNG actors and well yeah know how that went lol...like between Ghostbusters and turtles Trek was there for Xmas, easter , bdays like anything toy, model, frank mint collectible or other wise collectible I had it my mom worked stupid hard for me and my sister and brother to have what we had growing up and that in its self wasn't overly much but mom seen how trek made an impact on my life and saw how it affected how I seen the world and what its about... as I grew older we had to move ALOT started in Ontario ended up in Nova Scotia only for me to move back to Ontario, London actually with nothing but 2 duffle bags and maybe like my phone and 60 bucks... I lost... all of it or at least a HUGE portion of it all but after living on the street here and getting in to all sorts of shenanigans I started seeing kids that were mine come in to my life so I turned it around started working towards stability and like a real life again... Trek helped me get through that, all of it good and bad AS well.... but I got to a point where I said I want what I haad back in life related to trek so I did it as the pics will show it, it took a pretty short period of time to get what I have back, but shhhh! dont tell their moms my kids 2 daughters 9 and 10 and my son 12 they all watch it all with me new and old, pretty cool eh....

now with that being said Discovery....  
All I have to say is WOW!!!

First off season 1 yeah sure I haad my gripes about certain things but I moved past it cause it was Trek and like the kelvin movies I liked it it was mainly changed the way they did sure some corporate sh!t more then likely but mainly to draw new fans to our vast collective Trek has built in this world... but I am gonna go out on limb and assume every one has seen the 1st season here so let get to the main thing here

S2

number 1... S2 as a whole is great so far every episode reminded me of like episodes from older series fight me over it go ahead but I wanna hope TRUE fans can see that they clearly listened to us fans with what we felt was off last season and worked towards fixing some stuff and like yeha know what I mean though and like the overall season story arc they have led up to I think will end in explaining why and how Micheal is the apparent adoptive child of Sarak and Amanda and why they built Discovery in the first place and why the war was started and happened when it did cause in the books you'll see in my pics here it states that I am pretty sure the earth-Klingon war did't happen at the Binary nor in the time frame that episode was set in so it leads me to speculate that the season were in is going to explain the Time Paradox her mom has created due to a chain of events caused by S31 and their experiments in the past and maybe maybe when her mom and dad were presumed dead she gets sent to Vulcan to live with Spock and them but when that placed gets bombed and she runs away and the Red Angel confronts Spock to save Micheal it creates a paradox event that then sent in to motion every thing we have learned up to this point on the show... that said about Control I seen a similar post from this group about how control is named Control in the redditversse some where, the OP said that ""Control is called Control cause the show runners didn't wanna out themselves for making a solid origin to the Borg and wanted to fans to come to that conclusion by the last Act of the season final where it would depict a seen in the very distant past connnecting it somehow to the borg and there yeah have it...""... I read that and the rest of the thread and I like lost IQ points like are you guys flat eathers to lol.

now Pike and Spock.... what can I say about that duo for alot of it I am speechless...

Pike for one k... Anson mount has completely sold me on the character thru and thru to the point that if Mr. Hunter in the Cage had the real chance to play out the role and still to the point of his tragic end for character depth and what not Anson mount in my honest opinion has won me over to think that is how pike would have been played out, just they acting alone but in that is like the way he presents him self as pike on the bridge towards his fellows shipmates like how talks and how he smirks and just how tall he seems in the captains chair and soon like the goosebumbs will be like packing and leaving my skin cause we will get to see him sit in the real chair next episode... like I had strong feels during that pike scene in the monastery like know what I know of pike from the cage and his return to Talos 4 and from books or comics that had some from of version written bout his life...

Well as for another version Spock in my life time alone lol...

Spock is one of if not in my top 5 favorite fictional characters of all time like from this point in time today as i type this out dating back to like say I dunno adam and eve or what ever origin of humanity you believe in like top 5 hands down...

Ethan Peck thus has shown me a side of the Spock I know that sure maybe is new for this series and story they are building with Discovery as a whole but it is information to me that makes perfect sense about Spock as a whole to me and fills gaps in his story I feel are an added bonus to the character like I dunno I have to see any official news saying he was done after this season is up but would it not be uber cool for him to stay on for at least S3 to like develop his and micheals clearly new found and looks pretty fixed relationship but also like in his off time kept in constant contact with pike that way to show us the loyalty and honor and what have you towards that man when he take a broken man to Talos 4 to finish his life in complete peace.. I just think when they actually brought him on screen we were getting close to season final as it seeing what 2 episodes left and to be honest I enjoy the main cast but I kinda wanna see more Spock...

all that said in the world today we see so much hate and war and hunger and every that goes against what the great bird in the sky saw for humanity and it kills me that I can be that observant and like I dunno there are a few other words to use but my memory thing is hitting a wall right now and it suck but that said like I stated trek keeps me up going past all of it and I live a pretty decent life to like not give a damn about it all but I pay attention to it all to be able to make informed choices and such and be able to teach my kids the real meaning of peace and love and working together in hopes they will take it as they grow older and new generation will adapt to be the better world he foresaw for us...

So please guys and gals I get it, its new trek some concepts in it were not used to seeing on a constant basis in our beloved franchise, like its 2019 here people the 21st C here people get over your self's like honestly, we have homosexuality, we have flat eathers stil to this day lol, we have people that believe in majics still, like hell people can identify as what ever they want hopefully with in reason maybe and document that shit on actual gov. paperwork like how are you not expecting trek to modernize like its doing like 60 years ago was a different era when trek started so like of course its going to take from that point in modern life with the future aspects and trek history it incorporated... respect the past and embrace the future people maybe help by not bashing the hell out of this cause if CBS randomly states they are done with trek cause they cant bend over for every little detail so your gonna go all star wars fanboy on them and boycott it and they just like pretend trek dont exsist I will come on this super highway find out everything BOUT YOU AND MAKE IT LIKE YOU DONT EXSIST(LOL KIDDING i DONT HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR THAT KINDA POWER TO DO IT ).... but wouldnt it make you feel uber stupid if us fans kicked up a horrible stink about how someones hair looked or oh know its 2019 and its a fictional depicting the utopia style of humanity among the stars and that guy just kissed another guy and then bam all trek was gone for good cause people couldn't adapt and grow with and let it be its thing.... lets help make the world a better people and all get along and be good cause who knows when it all will be gone and then what cause we now have this and I seem to remeber what 5 other shows in the works for CBS and trust me ma they paramount cooking something or 2 for the big screen... this few years are gonna be huge for trek maybe possibly trump those marvels and what they got the last 11 years heck even DC to suck it all of you other attempts built franchises were making a huge come back and were all over the time line with it

sorrys its long I know there are many mistakes and what have so dont be a troll bout it and take it for what it is and like I dunno be kind dammit

I have done nothing but chain vape. Long story short, if I got off it for a month my wife said she would buy me a 3ds of my choice. Very close to the mark. Truth is, we don't really have a lot of money with kids and bills. I really wanted a N3DS non XL so badly but they are so high on eBay and I would feel so guilty if I asked my wife for one. She got me one a while back and it came in defective. She spent 140 on it. I really felt like complete crap. Nintendo wanted 80 bucks to fix it. Luckily someone was willing to buy it 20 bucks less than what we paid for it and I spent 30 dollars buying a 2DS XL. 

I'm proud of myself for kicking a nasty habit but I told my wife I would be happy with a 60 dollar refurbished 2ds from Nintendo. It's a half lie. I'm always greatful if she gets me anything, I just couldn't bring myself to ask her for the one I wanted the most. Something about those XL's I just don't like. It's like setting to close to a TV and seeing every flaw in footage. If that makes sense. I'm probably going to on the 2DS more than the XL model. ",new_subreddit,0,2019-04-08 00:59:59

We apologize,0,3cbo4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/,20856,1436204196.0,"We screwed up. Not just on July 2, but also over the past several years. We haven’t communicated well, and we have surprised moderators and the community with big changes. We have apologized and made promises to you, the moderators and the community, over many years, but time and again, we haven’t delivered on them. When you’ve had feedback or requests, we haven’t always been responsive. The mods and the community have lost trust in me and in us, the administrators of reddit.

Today, we acknowledge this long history of mistakes. We are grateful for all you do for reddit, and the buck stops with me. We are taking three concrete steps:

**Tools**: We will improve tools, not just promise improvements, building on work already underway.  u/deimorz and u/weffey will be working as a team with the moderators on what tools to build and then delivering them.

**Communication**: u/krispykrackers is trying out the new role of Moderator Advocate. She will be the contact for moderators with reddit and will help figure out the best way to talk more often. We’re also going to figure out the best way for more administrators, including myself, to talk more often with the whole community.

**Search**: We are providing an option for moderators to default to the old version of search to support your existing moderation workflows. Instructions for setting this default are [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search#wiki_enabling_legacy_search).

I know these are just words, and it may be hard for you to believe us. I don't have all the answers, and it will take time for us to deliver concrete results. I mean it when I say we screwed up, and we want to have a meaningful ongoing discussion. I know we've drifted out of touch with the community as we've grown and added more people, and we want to connect more. I and the team are committed to talking more often with the community, starting now.

Thank you for listening. Please share feedback here. Our team is ready to respond to comments.

There has been a lot of discussion lately —on reddit, in the news, and here internally— about reddit’s policy on the more offensive and obscene content on our platform. Our top priority at reddit is to develop a comprehensive Content Policy and the tools to enforce it.

The overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don’t have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.

Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen:  These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. It’s something we’ve been thinking about for quite some time.  We haven’t had the tools to enforce policy, but now we’re building those tools and reevaluating our policy.

We as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, I’ll be hosting an AMA on Thursday 1pm pst to present our current thinking to you, the community, and solicit your feedback.

PS - I won’t be able to hang out in comments right now. Still meeting everyone here!",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-07-14 16:06:56

"I am a Priest in the Church of Satan. Nevermind the crazies, let's have fun and ask me anything!",0,1zg23j,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/,3360,1393866278.0,"Over the past several weeks Satanism, directly and indirectly, has caught the attention of the media. Lunatics are blaming the Devil for their deranged acts of violence, rumors of ""Satanic"" cults are spreading among the tabloids and fans of True Detective are searching for the Yellow Sign in satanic rituals. Peter H. Gilmore, the current High Priest of the Church of Satan, has been [a guest on CNN](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/17/satanist-church-accused-craigslist-killer-not-one-of-us/), [interviewed by the CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/day6/popupaudio.html?clipIds=2438899671) and numerous other outlets (published and unpublished) in an effort to defuse a revival of the Satanic Panic from 80's and 90's. It's a shame that for many people the only exposure to Satanism is in reaction to such grim, pointless insanity; when by and large the Satanists I know are some the most life-loving individuals I've ever encountered. 

Due to the recent media exposure I'm not surprised to see several threads hitting the front page of Reddit mentioning Satanism, attempted AMA's from questionable sources, and a genuine interest in what Satanism and the Church of Satan is actually about. Obviously one can go to the Church of Satan's website and [check out the basic texts](http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php) and [FAQ](http://churchofsatan.com/frequently-asked-questions.php), but we recognize that humans are social creatures and a certain level of interaction can help drive points home.  

That said, my name is Raul A. and I'm an officially ordained Priest in the Church of Satan, and have been an active Satanist for over 10 years. In my time with the Church of Satan, and well before that, I've interacted with Satanists with a wide range of interests, personalities, and backgrounds. I've organized concerts with Satanic folk bands to experimental electronic musicians. I am the technical director of [Radio Free Satan](http://www.radiofreesatan.com/). My wedding was officiated by a Satanic Priest, I enjoyed Tiki drinks and 50's music with High Priestess Peggy Nadramia, and watched Kaiju films and talked Pacific Rim with High Priest Gilmore. I've also known many nonpublic Satanists who, for various reasons, cannot openly proclaim their worldviews.   

Why am I doing this AMA? For one, I think the Reddit community is interested in the topic and has been mostly given a poor representation of what Satanism is about, in theory and practice. I've seen some fairly interesting questions go without responses, and mostly a lot of talk from people who ""read Crowley in high school"" (FYI, Crowley never identified himself as a Satanist, and has very little to with Satanism) or ""knew a guy once"". Responses are often such a bore and miss the point entirely.  

So here's your chance, ask me anything! And, like any decent Satanist, let's make this fun! Let's try things other than the usual ""Why call it Satanism if you don't believe in Satan"" (*), let's talk about life, experiences, and the pleasures of the material world! Let the games begin!  

Proof: http://imgur.com/a/wAPvz?gallery

* The ""Satan"" in ""Satanism"" refers to the Hebrew word for ""the adversary"", and that is the context in which we use it. We understand that the human animal has an innate need for religion, symbolism, and dogma so we Satanists willfully choose the one we most identify with.

Edit: I have a business call to attend to for an hour or so, I'll be back shortly!

Edit: Seems that many of my responses have been downvoted to Hell (ba dum). Here's a handy Q&A table http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/  

Edit: Time to roll up the tent. Overall I had a fairly good time, answered a few good questions, made some new friends, and ran into some old ones. If you haven't seen my responses, especially in the first few hours of this AMA, it's because my comments were immediately being downvoted and hidden from the default views([I didn't realize Reddit were such big fans of the Westboro Baptist Church](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/cfte5pu)).

TIFU by destroying my girlfriend's family :(,0,2lgk2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2lgk2j/tifu_by_destroying_my_girlfriends_family/,1431,1415265547.0,"I've been dating an amazing girl for a bit over a year now. She's pretty chill and progressive, but she comes from a VERY conservative protestant family. Frankly, it's amazing that she isn't disowned - her parents and siblings obviously love her very much, but every time we go to visit they are not shy about voicing their disapproval of her lifestyle choices. Thankfully they're all cordial and the concerns are voiced civilly so there's no raised voices or hurt feelings, but not being part of the family these lectures are quite uncomfortable for me. ESPECIALLY since I'm not spared from her family's criticism.

As you can imagine we don't visit them much. They were kind enough to extend a dinner invitation on Wednesday evening, and since we hadn't seen them in a month or so we took them up on it. Despite the occasional awkward disapproving interjection (which we're both used to by now) things were going well... that is, until I let slip that she and I were thinking about moving in together. At that point her father gave me the coldest gaze I'd ever seen. And he wouldn't stop fucking GLARING at me. From that point on he had no qualms about interrupting me every time I spoke, quoting bible passages to insult me or contradict every single thing I would say in some fashion. I may not have been on exactly the same page as her father before, but we'd gotten along okay nonetheless... it definitely seemed like he was just being rude, obnoxious, and particularly confrontational. Now I'm an extremely even-tempered guy, but he was bagging on me to the extent that I had to excuse myself four goddamn times during dinner because he was pissing me off and I needed to cool down. There were multiple instances where his daughter and wife would even comment on his mean attitude but he seemed to just totally ignore them. This guy obviously intended to goad me.

After dessert my girlfriend and her mother are washing dishes, leaving me and her father alone at the dining room table. After a brief awkward silence I decided to straight-up ask him why he was so upset with me. He revealed that he was wholeheartedly against the idea of his daughter living with an ""unscrupulous heathen"" (his literal words) as that pretty much guaranteed premarital sex. I'd had enough of his shit by this point and decided a dose of reality would straighten him out, but emotion certainly got the best of me and my delivery was incredibly crass. ""If you think it took more than a few weeks to twist your daughter into all kinds of kinky pretzels you can't even imagine and stuff various objects into every hole in her body then you're just being willfully ignorant."" In my defense, I was being honest... she's ridiculously kinky. I still feel bad for being so disrespectful, though.

I have never been punched out of anger before, so when this 64 year old man lunged across the table and struck me I was caught completely off guard. I'm a regular gym-goer and participated in martial arts in the past, but none of that mattered - the next thing I knew I was on my back with this previously-very-collected elderly fellow on top of me in a blood rage. Still dazed from smacking my head on the ground when my chair tipped over, it was all I could do to try and deflect his onslaught of wild blows. It seemed like a fucking eternity before his wife and daughter pulled him off me. I stood up and could feel the sting of blood dripping into my eye. I could taste it in my mouth. I was still dizzy and disoriented but it was obvious that I'd received some pretty solid blows. While I was slightly embarrassed that someone almost twice my age handed me my ass, I nevertheless felt like I won. Like I got him to snap even though he'd been working on me for hours.

My girlfriend ushered me into the bathroom and began to gingerly tend my wounds. Her mother and father were hollering back and forth incomprehensibly in the dining room downstairs; when I heard them say her name I assured her I was fine on my own and urged her to deal with her folks. More incomprehensible yelling ensued, though my girlfriend's voice now joined the chorus. Around the time I'd managed to staunch the bleeding from my eyebrow she returned with my coat and said simply, ""We're leaving."" She was angrier than I'd ever seen her yet managed to remain collected. Normally when we'd leave her parents' house there were fond farewells... warm handshakes, hugs, wishes for prosperity, and blessings abound. Not this time, though. This time there was only her mother crying alone at the dinner table; we didn't even stop to say good-bye. Her father was nowhere to be found. Nothing but silence while we got into the car and left the driveway. A few miles down the road I noticed tears in my girlfriend's eyes. I wanted to be there for her, to comfort her in some way, but I just didn't know how. ""Do you want to talk about it?"" I asked, feeling stupid that I couldn't come up with something more suave to break the silence. ""Not right now"" she said, her voice strained against the flood of emotion. I put one of my hands in hers and squeezed ever so slightly, letting her know without words that I was there for her when she was ready. She squeezed back, refusing to break down sobbing even as large, heavy tears rolled down her face. We rode the rest of the way without saying anything.

**TL;DR**: *SO's dad intentionally pushes my buttons HARD. I tell him I thoroughly fucked his daughter. He physically attacks me. Everyone loses.*

I shouldn't need to say it, but the person who took the EU screenshot is 1 hour ahead of my time-zone, hence why it looks like it was at the same time, but that person's timezone was GMT+1, whereas mine is GMT+0.

Now considering the only other evidence we have from recent times about viewership numbers between regions was the Summer finals, which also had a lot more viewers for EU over NA, this narrative of ""NA gets more viewers"" seems completely false, even when given a faster better broadcast slot, the numbers don't seem to back the statement up.

EDIT: Don't know why people are trying to argue against facts with their own opinions. This are statistics, facts, things that are provable true.

Your trying to argue against that with your opinions. That's irrelevant.

EDIT2: I didn't realise how stupid NA viewers actually were, this was an impressive example. Your example of the NFL play-offs actually benefits my own argument, with the EU broadcast time-slot, it's like having NFL play-offs every single broadcast.

And yet EU still gets more viewers.

But thanks for the comments and whispers, I enjoyed how angry you all got over facts.",controversial_subreddit,0,2016-01-17 07:39:54

"reddit changes: individual up/down vote counts no longer visible, ""% like it"" closer to reality, major improvements to ""controversial"" sorting",0,28hjga,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/,14064,1403120379.0,"""Who would downvote this?"" It's a common comment on reddit, and is fairly often followed up by someone explaining that reddit ""fuzzes"" the votes on everything by adding fake votes to posts in order to make it more difficult for bots to determine if their votes are having any effect or not. While it's always been a necessary part of our anti-cheating measures, there have also been a lot of negative effects of making the specific up/down counts visible, so we've decided to remove them from public view.

The ""false negativity"" effect from fake downvotes is especially exaggerated on very popular posts. It's been observed by quite a few people that every post near the top of the frontpage or /r/all seems to drift towards showing ""55% like it"" due to the vote-fuzzing, which gives the false impression of reddit being an extremely negative site. As part of hiding the specific up/down numbers, we've also decided to start showing much more accurate percentages here, and at the time of me writing this, the top post on the front page has gone from showing ""57% like it"" to ""96% like it"", which is much closer to reality.

(Edit: since people seem confused, the ""% like it"" is only on *submissions*, as it always has been.)

As one other change to go along with this, /u/umbrae recently rolled out a much improved version of the ""controversial"" sorting method. You should see the new algorithm in effect in threads and sorts within the past week. Older sorts (like ""all time"") may be out of date while we work to update old data. Many of you are probably accustomed to ignoring that sorting method since the previous version was almost completely useless, but please give the new version another shot. It's available for use with submissions as a tab (next to ""new"", ""hot"", ""top""), and in the ""sorted by"" dropdown on comments pages as well.

This change may also have some unexpected side-effects on third-party extensions/apps/etc. that display or otherwise use the specific up/down numbers. We've tried to take various precautions to make the transition smoother, but please let us know if you notice anything going horribly wrong due to it.

I realize that this probably feels like a very major change to the site to many of you, but since the data was actually misleading (or outright false in many cases), the usefulness of being able to see it was actually mostly an illusion. Please give it a chance for a few days and see if things ""feel"" better without being able to see the specific up/down counts.",controversial_subreddit,0,2014-06-18 14:39:39

Now we can get to the story. 

So this happened last night as I was sitting at home with my Girlfriend of a year. A comercial for Taco Bells new cheesy burrito thing came on. My girlfriend has some serious munchies because she wanted to go get one really badly. Being an amazing boyfriend I surprise her by taking her there later that night. We go and pick up 3 of them and started heading back to my place. Then I get the romantic idea to take her to the local lake to look at the stars while we eat. Everything was going amazing, it was nice and cool outside, the stars were out and bright. Then she asks for some hot sauce to go with her burrito. As I'm grabbing for it I realize that this was the same exact place we met about a year ago at a college party. I give her the packet and then reach for one for me. The next thing I hear is a lound scream and then ""Yes, yes. Oh god yes."" I turn around to see her in tears and smiling at me.  I'm fucking confused as hell at this point. Then she says ""Of course I will marry you!"" 

Ends up I had given her [this]( http://imgur.com/on3S4ch) hot sauce packet. She had never seen one that said this before, so she thought I had gotten them to write it on there for her. It was a very awkward rest of the night....",controversial_subreddit,0,2014-08-10 16:43:24

While there are many legitimate reasons for us to be angry, upset, and for some of us just plain pissed off, we need to keep in mind both [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and some general respect for not only the opinions of others, but for those who are just doing their job.

We should be focusing more on constructive feedback, general ideas, and discussion. Having the constant reposts of bashing, inappropriate and disrespectful posts and titles, and just complete disregard for any sort of respect has quickly turned this subreddit into something where [not only the developers](https://twitter.com/andrewwillmott/status/311950660964859905), but just general users have been pushed away from. Users who have posted legitimate questions about concerns, general fixes, or just some ideas for towns or actual discussion have quickly been buried in favor of posts which just follow the general trend of bashing. While this may be okay in other subreddits, I feel that this is not the kind of atmosphere we want in r/SimCity.

 Existing posts will not be removed based on this material, but newer posts which do not provide any sort of constructive feedback or general discussion towards SimCity (including excess foul language, abuse towards others, and personal attacks aimed at the team or specific people) has the potential to be removed by me or the other moderators on the team.

* Memes will be removed
* Only constructive posts are allowed: Posts that clearly define the problem ~~and give possible solutions~~. We're not looking for people to fix the game for EA or Maxis, we're looking for respectful reporting methods. Ex: ""PSA: The population feature is broken. It's given a false read to the user which can negatively impact gameplay"" is much more efficient than ""Fuck this game, everything is lying to us this piece of crap"" Posts that are pure bashing or don't offer any sensible advice will be deleted.
* Only posts that are directly related to the game, thus excluding general EA bashing, Origin bashing and other things that only attract hate.
* **Absolutely NO personal Information.** This is not only a rule of the subreddit, but of [Reddit itself](http://www.reddit.com/rules).

(These rules are holding here for the time being until we can get the subreddit back on track. These points and the general works of the subreddit will be placed up for public discussion where we can all vote and rule out things that we want/don't want to see. Until then, please follow these posting guidelines.)

We will soon be updating the sidebar with some more posting guidelines to help narrow down what we are looking to filter out. While we understand anger due to the new game and behavior that we have received from EA, Origin, and SimCity, we need to understand there are those who are just doing their job and really have no control over the outcome of your conversation with them (obviously this is not the case for all). While posting here, we are going to request some respect from you as a Subreddit. There is plenty of content offering excellent feedback and constructive criticism towards the game – which is exactly what we want.  

So we’ve all had our fun, but it’s time we get SimCity back on track. Many users have been reporting abusive posts and messaging the mods about questionable content - It’s important to understand that we take every report and message and read through it thoroughly.

My wife and I have just had our third wonderful child. Not wanting a fourth, we agree I should get a vasectomy. No big deal: just a little snip and removes all the worries with contraception.

My doctor didn't seem to understand why I wanted it, but I quickly dismissed him, insisting I had thought hard about what I wanted and was not going to change my mind. Same with the consultant. I sign the papers and the operation is booked.

A few weeks later, after I wake up from the operation, everything feels fine but numb. Consultant gives me some strong warnings about being careful with my penis over the next fortnight, but I don't take it too seriously.

After my wife has driven me home, we take off my trousers to take a look at the scrotum scar. The head of my penis is wrapped in a soft bandage. She removes it and screams. I look down. It is covered in blood and we can't find my foreskin. Scrotum seems normal.

After we calm down, wife fetches my papers. Turns out I had booked myself in for a circumcision, not a vasectomy. Not their fault: my wife remembered me getting the words confused a few times over the past weeks as well.

Recovery was unpleasant. For a week, woke up every few hours in the middle of the night, somewhere between screaming and crying because the stitches were being stretched. Could not walk properly. Penis looks like someone else's. Two weeks after the operation, I am only just getting anywhere near back to normal. My boss is not impressed either.

Darius is the only champion who uses mana but can not run out of mana, even if he keeps spamming all his abilities the moment they come off cooldown.

2. Darius is the only champion who uses mana as resource and has a full combo mana cost of **105 mana** at level 18! The second lowest full combo mana cost is ..... Darius, pre-level 16 (with only 205 mana)!

3. Darius is the only mana champion of the whole game who has 4 abilities that do not need more mana when leveling up.


I'm not saying this makes Darius too strong, not at all. I'm fine with Darius the way he is, but I just find it a bit strange why Darius still uses mana as a resource if he can't run OOM in any way. It's kind of useless in my eyes.

Some suggestions:

-  Give his Q an increased mana cost. It is a high damage ability that cost 30 mana the whole game.

- Lower his base mana and/or mana per level.

- Remove mana as his resource, like Garen, or give it a new resource.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-09-03 08:11:01

The problem arises when you look at similar actions of other players in the past and Riot's response. 

Svenskeren chooses ""Taiwanese ChinChong"" as username --> 3 game ban, SK's chances of making it past the group stage demolished. Please note that this also has financial consequences because of the substantial loss of prize money.

Is Svenskeren an actual racist? Probably not. Was Hai's finger actually serious? Probably not. We can't prove either. 

But what we can do is demand consistency in Riot's application of the rules. Riot, a company from the USA, takes their understanding of morale and applies it to the whole world, ignoring the cultural context of the other contintents and countries. But when it comes to actions of players in their own region they respect the cultural context and hand no punishment.

This is inconsistent and regardless of what you think of Hai's finger shouldn't be accepted.

edit: I want to point out for the people that see a flaw in the comparison which can be discussed separately that Hai's finger violated the [2015 World Championship Rules](https://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/lolesports/Rule%20Sets/2015%20Revised%20World%20Championship%20Rule%20Set%20Version%201_01.pdf).

Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  

As a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.  Please discuss the issues and the comments made, not the persons making them.  If you find comments which violate our rules, you’re encouraged to use the report button or alert the mods via modmail so that we can investigate.

Thank you,

Is it wrong to give every single rune page a GoT spoiler as a name?,16,26y9r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/26y9r4/is_it_wrong_to_give_every_single_rune_page_a_got/,747,1401538114.0,"A little background: I hate lolnexus and similar sites. I learned to read the enemie's runes by clicking them and doing a little soft calculating.

I used to watch scarra's stream and I was amazed how he could just tell the runes onthe spot. ""Yeah, he probably has MS quints, but AP blues. And 21/9 masteries"". 

So I learned that and I developed a pretty good accuracy.

Now, here's the thing: I main Riven and I play her almost exclusively, but I'm only Gold. So whenever I get into a game, I get this ""WTF!? X Riven Games and only Gold? Noob!"" - from Silver summoners. It's worse if I equip the Championship skin, which I apparently bought for 700$.

Long story short:

**TL;DR:** The names of my most used rune pages are HUGE Game of Thrones Spoilers (like... ""XY dies next episode / next season"") and I get reported for that shit almost every game, but I don't care - If you scout somebody with 3rd party apps, it's your own risk.

Riot's ask.fm are finally killing my motivation for League of Legends,443,3ei2k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ei2k9/riots_askfm_are_finally_killing_my_motivation_for/,1683,1437778651.0,"I've played this game since season 1 and have countless hours of fun, laughter and enjoyment to thank it for.

Various things over the past couple of seasons have worn down my patience. At the end of the day, though, I still loved the game and could deal with the crap in the peripheries because I had hope that Riot would come good at some point.

Reading the ask.fm answers from Lyte and Ghostcrawler over the past few weeks have totally destroyed that hope. I always believed that - whilst Riot might be slow and frustrating - they had their hearts and minds in the right place. But the shit these two have been coming out with has made me realise that the problems aren't born out of anything I can come to terms with. Riot games is just running on philosophies I (and apparently many others) fundamentally and whole-heartedly disagree with and that is totally demoralising.

The sentiment I present seems to be very much shared by the majority on here and amongst people I play with. For the first time since I started playing, I think League's long-term future is at immediate risk.
 
I'm interested to hear the other side though. Perhaps this is just fatigue born out of playing the same game for too long (although I do still love the *game*). Perhaps newer players feel more optimistic. Perhaps I'm just a cynic.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-07-24 17:57:31

"The ""Toxicity"" in the community is so exaggerated.",297,23o7ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/23o7ix/the_toxicity_in_the_community_is_so_exaggerated/,1198,1398168131.0,"Honestly, This sub is plagued by people constantly moaning about the community and how they have ""quit the game"" or will ""never play ranked again"".

It's just ridiculous, the community is nowhere near as bad as a lot of these people make out. I'm currently in gold 3 on EUW and I see 1 or 2 ""toxic"" players in about 5 games of playing, so 2/45 (edited, I included myself 5 times) and most of the time if someone is being toxic the rest of the players just ignore them and deal with it very well.

I really think people need to grow up and realize sometimes people are going to flame or be a bit of an ass. But that's just life, it happens everywhere, not just in league.

But this will probably get down voted to the Reddit graveyard because apparently everyone on this sub is a ""victim"" of a game and it's community.

EDIT: When I stated my division and how many ""toxic"" players I encounter roughly, It was for the purpose of showing that I cannot speak necessarily for people in other divisions or servers. Players experience varies, and I am basing this post off my own experiences.

Also I'm not saying toxicity isn't a problem, I still think we need a system in place that rewards positive players and ""remedies"" the negative ones. However this sub seems to make out that every game is going to be a huge rage fest between your team, which is not the case. 

This kind of talk discourages new players and makes current players just feel bad for themselves, nothing good ever comes from it.",controversial_subreddit,0,2014-04-22 07:02:11

I do not remember much clearly from early seasons, or promo talks/vidoes, but ever since S5, NA was always most important. At IEM everyone knew that GE are strongest, and that it was major upset from WE, everyone talked like TSM could beat GE in Finals. At MSI, TSM again was overhyped, saying they could easy play on EDG and SKT level. There was even that player video, of NA players saying TSM will end in finals vs EDG or SKT. After summer split, even after FNC best season, Origen's super teamplay and H2K's good macro game show, CLG was overhyped since they won finals in MSG against TSM. During group draws if it wasn't for Deficio and Spawn to talk about every region, we know what Jatt or any NA caster would talk about. Even after them most talk was about CLG getting easiest group to get out. About KOO only was said that they are weakest team coming from LCK(they ended in finals !), Flash wolves were barely mentioned, they mentioned how Steak was bad top laner, but it was barely mentioned that Maple is super good mid laner. In Group B, ""group of death"", Deficio and Spawn, talked about all teams ( FNC,IG,AHQ,C9), Jatt was only speaking of C9 which ended in his twitter apology to Balls. In Group D ""the group of chance"" that maybe teams can upset KT or LGD, our dear friend Jatt talked about Bjergsen and TSM. At the start of S6 IMT were instantly compared to FNC of S5, even though their bottom 3 members can never be compared to likes of Febi,Rekkles,YS. 



After facing TSM , interview asked GMB how did he feel after Bjergsen. ??????? GBM was facing entire season mids like Faker,CoCo,Kuro,Nagne,Goong. What is Bjergsen compared to these mid laners ? Geez... Also Phreak non-stop keep mentioning how Hai is probably best shotcaller in League of Legends. Ughh , Phreak, remember a Korean mid laner called Dade?? The guy that C9 wanted to get, but couldn't compete with China. Dade, one of best LoL players to ever play, and main shotcaller of SSB, and probably shared shotcalling with Mata in Samsung Ozone(SSW). Next do u remember Mata ? Greatest support of all time. Do u remember YS, the guy that was praised by Picaboo,Gorilla,Wolf at worlds, also praised by Mata. LMS is barely ever mentioned. AHQ are probably better than IMT,H2K,VIT,G2, and they can't even get invited to 1 Internation event outside worlds and MSI ? Remember the top 20 players list? There is extreme bias from Riot's side but its more towards NA than towards any other region, not just TSM and C9",controversial_subreddit,0,2016-02-29 05:27:13

He picks Aatrox and once we are in the game he goes mid, starts feeding, and only buys tears of the goddess. He tricked us so nooone would dodge to then fuck the game for everyone. Kudos for that, that is just plain evil.

Second game: I was last pick, I said I'd fill. First pick picks Ahri, and third pick, for some reason, doesn't trust in Ahri and goes Nidalee and goes mid. At one point Ahri gets angry for not getting cs and goes afk. Neat.

Third game: I pick jungle Gragas and this top Rengar doesn't beleive in viability, and before giving me a chance, gives 3 kills to Fiora and goes afk. At this moment I'm not even mad, I'm amazed.

But because I'm stupid, I go for a 4th game: The Soraka in my team goes afk during laning phase because he didn't like our Ezreal, saying he couldn't hit q's. That Ezreal was me. I wasn't even aiming for the poke, I was securing cs. 

The result is -100lp  more or less. I almost never get angry (luckily), but holy shit wasn't I impressed.

Lesson learned. Wait till the kids are at school to play ranked. 


**Edit**: 

For those majored in statistics saying ""But the enemy team has more chances to get a troll than your team! You SHOULD play Ranked on Sundays"".

Turns out, I'm one of the few guys that plays for fun and not for elo. I don't enjoy 4v5, even when I'm the team with 5.

""BUT THEN WHY DO YOU PLAY RANKED, YOU TURD-MOLESTING QUIM?""

The answer is easy, ranked sticks to the meta. I like the meta. Ranked players are competitive (when they actually play), I like the competititve enviroment. 

**Edit 2**:

For those who are saying ""HE SAYS HE LIKES THE META AND THEN PICKS JUNGLE GRAGAS, WHAT A HYPOCRITE FILTHY TWAT""

Don't take my words of him being viable, take the words from a british Diamond 1 jungler main with a successful youtube channel called [Foxdrop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-lfrVwExbc)

**Edit 3**: [Busted!](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2s9lcu/the_dont_play_ranked_on_the_weekends_post_from/)

 Funniest part is how I got an angry mob at my back investing like an hour in this post. You can think what you want, I couldn't give less fucks. I gotta say doe, people are not angry because I lied. People are angry at me because I lied about some issue that everyone hates and made it to the front page within hours. Best part is, I lied about the matches, but the point of my post stays true, basically because of all the people that said I was right. Anyhow, hope you have a nice day! 

Oh, and by the way, there is one more fun thing. The post that calls me a liar is actually some kind of witch hunting and induces to hateful speech. Now look at the 4th point of the subreddit rules. You guys upvoted to 2k something against the rules of this subreddit. Thanks for summing up the people of this subreddit so easily.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-01-12 06:28:19
"[SPOILERS?] Samsung. I did my homework, I am over the hype.",0,2i1wa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2i1wa9/spoilers_samsung_i_did_my_homework_i_am_over_the/,830,1412215371.0,"You know what I've done every lunch break and dinner break the past 2 weeks?  Yup. You guessed it. Masturb...Jk

I queued up SSW and SSB matches and watched them. Lots of them. I learned a little Korean even!

I wanted to know what literally everybody was meaning when they were talking about  this perfect execution, the unbeatable team, this guaranteed 3-0 against all competition. I wanted to know why it was GG c9, GG TSM.

I looked at picks and bans, I looked at warding habits, I looked at laning abilities, I looked at team fighting.

And there is no doubt both of these teams are outstanding. A+. I saw a lot of trust, I saw a lot of expounding on strength. A lot of outplay of top tier competition.

And I saw a lot of weakness. I saw a lot of misplay. I saw a ton of solo laners leaving nexus without wards. I saw bravado, miscalculation of opposition summoners, and mistiming of objectives (based on backs).

And I will firmly stand my ground in this prediction: if TSM and C9 lose 0-3 to the Samsung's I will cosplay bunny riven ala Oddone.

Reasoning.

1. OVERHYPED, more so than I've ever seen in a competitive scene for any game or sport. This is not the 1980 ice hockey USSR vs USA, this is not David vs Goliath. This is 2 outstanding teams against 2 very very good teams. None of these 4 teams are 1 trick ponies. The difference? Underdogs have no pressure, no pressure 0-0, 0-1, 0-2. What happens if the home team somehow loses 1 game ? The pressure builds. 


2. At least 1 Samsung will lose to an NA team, and ""analysts"" will have some 'splainin to do.


3. I believe if I were strategizing against one of the Samsung's I could tilt a certain person and win the series alone off of that. If I were C9 I would look into that. I believe if I was strategizing against the other Samsung I would look very closely at how much fog of war ends up in certain areas of the map...its solo que.

Downvote me, criticize me, make fun if both TSM and C9 go 0-3, but after 40+ hours of watching these teams.....

I know this weekend is going to be competitive.

Edit: Just because this is getting so much hate, I wanted to emphasize out 4 things:

1. Self posts do not gain karma, So I do not give a fuck if you down or up vote this, if it is front page or obliterated. You have all in PM or in comments told me to kill myself and worse. So who is the better man?

2. It is funny watching people with Alliance flair saying that TSM or C9 cannot ""take a game"" off of a Samsung team when .. too soon? LOL

3. I am not going to post a single detail of anything specific in this thread, ever. I hope that the NA teams have done their homework. I am not providing that information in public forum BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO WIN. But the point is that this is not fucking some junior varsity high school football team against the Dallas Cowboys as all the ""analysts"" make it out to be. The matches will be close.

4. I will Cosplay Bunny Riven (Or anything upvoted to be a better option) if I am wrong within 72 hours of the final C9 game. PS:

We apologize,0,3cbnuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/3cbnuu/we_apologize/,2503,1436204078.0,"We screwed up. Not just on July 2, but also over the past several years. We haven’t communicated well, and we have surprised you with big changes. We have apologized and made promises to you, the moderators and the community, over many years, but time and again, we haven’t delivered on them. When you’ve had feedback or requests, we have often failed to provide concrete results. The mods and the community have lost trust in me and in us, the administrators of reddit.

Today, we acknowledge this long history of mistakes. We are grateful for all you do for reddit, and the buck stops with me. We are taking three concrete steps:

**Tools**: We will improve tools, not just promise improvements, building on work already underway.  Recently, u/deimorz has been primarily developing tools for reddit that are largely invisible, such as anti-spam and integrating Automoderator. Effective immediately, he will be shifting to work full-time on the issues the moderators have raised. In addition, many mods are familiar with u/weffey’s work, as she previously asked for feedback on modmail and other features. She will use your past and future input to improve mod tools. Together they will be working as a team with you, the moderators, on what tools to build and then delivering them.

**Communication**: u/krispykrackers is trying out the new role of Moderator Advocate. She will be the contact for moderators with reddit. We need to figure out how to communicate better with them, and u/krispykrackers will work with you to figure out the best way to talk more often.

**Search**: The new version of search we rolled out last week broke functionality of both built-in and third-party moderation tools you rely upon. You need an easy way to get back to the old version of search, so we have provided that option. Learn how to set your preferences to default to the old version of search [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search#wiki_enabling_legacy_search).


I know these are just words, and it may be hard for you to believe us. I don't have all the answers, and it will take time for us to deliver concrete results. I mean it when I say we screwed up, and we want to have a meaningful ongoing discussion.


Thank you for listening. Please share feedback here. Our team is ready to respond to comments.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-07-06 12:34:38
"Blizz, I'm finally mad.",90,41ub38,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/41ub38/blizz_im_finally_mad/,737,1453296233.0,"Let me preface with my bona fides:

* I started on Blizzard with WarCraft I and have played every Blizz title except WoW and Diablo III.
* I've been playing Heroes since alpha, every mode, extensively, every day.
* I have three Heroes accounts and have spent a decent bit of cash on each.
* I make a point to regularly discuss the game with players at the top of Master League.
* I have never shitposted about any Blizzard game... until today.

Let's review the state of the game.

* No balance patch in over **TWO MONTHS**, *AFTER* massive scaling changes that totally rebalanced every hero in the game.
* Serious, ongoing information lag in notifying users of upcoming new content (e.g., we **still don't know when the balance patch is coming**).
* After all that silence and all those player requests for info, a bullshit *question mark* (!!!) for empty hype-train purposes, instead of actual concrete word on what's ahead for the game.
* Announcement of a huge amount of money to be thrown into tournaments with no sign of similar commitment of resources to features *actually anticipated by the community* like Arena, clans, map editor, *the fucking emote wheel that got ""temporarily"" removed a while back* (remember that, guys?), etc.
* **FIVE** of the last six hero releases (Rexxar, Artanis, Cho'gall, Lunara, Greymane) have all come out **severely** undertuned and competitively near-unusable. (And Medic started pretty crappy and has only come into her own after the scaling changes.)
* Per HOTSLogs winrates, *TWO-THIRDS* of heroes are currently below 50% winrate. Fourteen heroes are below 46%, which is equal to the ENTIRE roster above 50% winrate. The game has calcified into a narrow range of OP picks with everyone else getting short shrift. And remember, Blizz saw this starting to happen after **November** and has sat on its hands since then.
* The Recruit-a-Friend fiasco where dedicated players who'd already recruited for Blizz got fucked over and had to make smurf accounts in order to grind out the most anticipated mount in the game.

I'm sure I could come up with more given a few more minutes to steam, but I think this is quite enough for starters.

Blizz, this is **NOT** good game management. This is **NOT** good treatment of your consumer base.

I've carried a LOT of water for Blizz over the years. I've sold a lot of friends on Blizz games, and defended a lot of Blizz games against what I felt were unjust criticisms. Blizz, I am the epitome of the customer you want. I follow your games for years, I spend lots of money on them, and I defend them to my friends.

And you're fucking. Me. Over.

Stop. Please.

I love this game. I love Blizz as an idea. I understand a lot of these things are being pushed by corporate and not the dev team per se (love you devs, I'm sure you're doing the best you can with what you've got, my ire is largely directed elsewhere). But we can't go on like this.

* **Get on a fucking schedule.** Sorry, but Soon(TM) doesn't cut it with a MOBA. We need to know when heroes are coming out and when balance patches are expected.
* **Cut it with the fucking cloak and dagger.** We understand software development is not an exact science. Let us know what you've got in the works. Don't drip-feed us information that we have to beat out of you.
* **Don't treat your player base like a bunch of fucking chumps.** Focus on what the community asks for. Give older players a chance to buy / grind out incentives for newer players.
* **Test new heroes better pre-release.** There's no excuse for Greymane's W bug not getting caught and fixed before he came out. There's no excuse for the myriad of horrendous glitches that affected Rexxar upon his initial release. There's no way you didn't know Lunara was going to be seriously underpowered. You've done pretty well on a long string of releases in the past (e.g. Sylvanas, TLV, Leoric, Johanna), so I know you can get it together again.

I still love you, Blizz. I'm mad, but I love you. Let's make up. Let's make Heroes greater than ever before.

Tagging /u/Trikslyr and /u/Spyrian because c'mon, guys, we deserve some answers.

**EDIT:** Lots of talk about tone. I'm passionate about the game and really unhappy with some of the decisions made about it lately, but you guys are right -- honey catches more flies than vinegar. I apologize for the harshness of the tone. I have a lot of respect for the Heroes dev team and I would not want them to feel like I'm unfairly rancorous.",controversial_subreddit,0,2016-01-20 07:23:53

"[SPOILER] Not a witchhunt, not personal hate, not trash talk. But we need to have a frank and serious discussion about Doublelift.",20,1te2pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1te2pc/spoiler_not_a_witchhunt_not_personal_hate_not/,645,1387624991.0,"*This post was deleted when I first put it up, under the title ""I'm probably about to lose all my karma for this - but bench Doublelift"", so I've amended the title somewhat. The text is completely the same.*

Dramatic, drastic?

OK, first of all, absolutely none of us have the experience of running an org as big as CLG - unless Reginald is reading this - but I do have experience in running one back on CoD (60% of people reading this post just disregarded it) and I remember taking the decision to bench star players. We particularly had two, one of which was as mouthy as Doublelift for the same confidence reasons I assume he has (i.e. it boosted his own confidence) but when benched, the team was way better for it. We actually got our Golden Age era team out of it.

I put it to you that the FPS genre matured away from carry players around a year into LoL's run, and LoL matured into it this year.

This will be inevitable with any game, as the roster for players leans away from prodigies and those there from the start and instead becomes saturated with up and coming talent. The market is now filled with amazing potential, untapped, for example Pobelter who was strung along by Curse but EG have proven to be more than capable.

When thinking about this whole situation, I like to think of Pobeleter as the anti-Doublelift. The kid has school, divides his time, isn't in the business of talking trash yet performed obscenely well. Doublelift has an entourage that now includes Montecristo and isn't performing.

So here are my points.

1) **Doublelift is part of a meta that doesn't exist anymore - the carry Gods.** Each game has a period where they exist. CoD, BF, CS, WoW, LoL. But they are becoming less and less relevant. SKT T1 shows us this. Faker is a carry God, but Piglet most impressed me and I'm sure many others with his solid consistent play, and Bengi's pink ward spam carry jungling was the deciding factor in many games. These guys aren't winning because of Faker - they are winning because they are 5 Solo Queue gods in one, something every team should be.

2) **Doublelift is now the unofficial captain on the ground, and forgets commander HotshotGG's orders.** This is speculation to an extent. I do not know the politics of CLG but it seems to me, as with everyone, that after Montecristo's strategy shows the slightest flaw, CLG default to feed-the-Doublelift. As mentioned above, that just doesn't work anymore. Whether it is Doublelift making these calls or not, removing him removes the temptation for whoever IS making this terrible call. You have Montecristo for a reason - his plans WILL work. Maybe you see a hole somewhere, but there is a gigantic whole in feed-the-Doublelift. It doesn't win.

3) **Doublelift is a liability now.** Remember the All-Stars? I do, because that was the first ever League of Legends tournament I watched. Yes, I am this new. Doublelift Penta-killed EU and I was all sads, but respectful. Then I heard his trash talk and I was still respectful. I did this a LOT in CoD and so did many others (not in the screaming console way, we were PC, which is pretty dead now). it's good for fans, hype and is healthy if used in the proper context. It threads a story. However:

* **Doublelift was praised heavily for his laning ability, which Xpecial claimed to be almost perfect.** He has not won lane hard, with any sort of consistency, for ages. This is not hist strength anymore.

* **Doublelift's mechanics are not the best anymore.** Sometimes they are great, but then he's as good as many Chinese, Korean and even NA ADC's are. They are not out-of-this-world anymore. This opinion will get me a lot of hate, but we all watched worlds.

* **Doublelift does not carry the strategic potential (lol) that other ADC's have.** Again, his laning was praised heavily, his mechanics too, but his awareness is sub-par. Always has been.

Doublelift is a liability more than anything. He was a star player back when the meta revolved around players like him in S2, but even then I suspect HotshotGG having in-game control over him proved useful.

4) **He doesn't just let down the fans, he makes them feel ashamed.** This was never more relevant than now. I'm an EU player and an EU fan but this was actually heart breaking. I couldn't bring myself to do the post-game trash I usually do on Twitter, because I can see where fans are coming from.

Doublelift is known for his trash talk, and I said it was healthy - in context. I think EU players get it, since eSports was big-ish over here even prior to league. If I trash talked, it was about bigging ourselves up. Striatus is practiced, we know what we're doing, etc. Doublelift and alot of NA players just go at the opponents flaws. For a region so far behind right now that is not the right attitude. But the worst is when it comes back to hit you in the face.

Doublelift, do you realise how much worse you make it for your fans? It isn't even about getting their hopes up - it's that you insulted their friends teams, their friends favourite players, their friends big hopes. And then you vindicate them. You put your fans in such awkward positions. You managed to make so many EU players mad with your comments, comments your fans had to defend. What do you think happened afterwards?

If nothing else, if Doublelift is kept, if his gameplay doesn't change at all and CLG delve further and further into the unknown abyss of non-existence. Please, PLEASE just change that aspect. Big yourself up, yes, fine, OK, you are a God. But don't set yourself up to get Rekked just to throw your fans in the worst positions. It's shameful.

**Conclusion**

None of us will ever have something as big as CLG have. The few people here who recognise me know we only had up to the tens of thousands of followers. You guys are literally into tens of millions. But fundamental issues exist that are plain for everyone to see.

This is simple. The playbook has been laid out for you. The backlash as already occured. I am of course talking about Chaox.
It will not be the end of the world, it will be a necessary event. This time, fans will understand because they have gone through this before, seen others go through it, and TSM ended up pulling it out and winning.

CLG need to let go of a lot because a lot isn't working. But it's not as difficult as it looks.

That's just my two cents. I await the hate I'll inevitably receive from his bigger followers, but hopefully we can have a good discussion about this matter, because it needs to be had.

EDIT DOS: So I have to go Christmas shopping, I just want to clarify the title since one of the threads is debating how serious Reddit can be. I am fully aware that CLG likely have their own plan for this, and in the end they will come to their own conclusions, but orgs work for their fans as much as anyone and so I opened up this discussion. Hotshot browses Reddit regularly, and this is a big part of it that I felt needed to be discussed. They can disregard what happens in this thread or not, it is just all opinion, but the fans and community deserve their say.

Remember when Riot gave us a skin for participating in season one? Remember when every new champion didn't cost 6300? Remember when every champion released didn't have AN ENTIRE NEW PRICE TIER at the INCREDIBLY UNREASONABLE 7800IP?

Remember when every single new skin wasn't 975 (Or higher)? Remember when Riot released festive icons that we could easily obtain? Then remember when they stopped doing that and started charging 1500IP and 250RP?

Then remember when they stopped charging the IP and left the 250RP?

Remember when Riot was a fun company? Because I do.

Everyone wants to say ""Oh it's just an icon."" Or ""No one makes you spend money on this game, you can play free if you want."" But this isn't about the content. It's about Riot making a promise, it's about Riot saying and confirming something, and then completely going against it. It doesn't matter how large or small it is. A broken promise is a broken promise. And if they break promises about it being ""JUST AN ICON"" then God only knows what they'll do to us in the future.",controversial_subreddit,0,2014-08-11 14:38:36
Fix Undying.,58,35c9xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/35c9xw/fix_undying/,437,1431125171.0,"Since 6.84 was introduced and the meta was changed, Undying became the hero with the highest win rate (62.02%). I don't judge heroes by win rate, but watching pro/pub matches and the community's reaction, I came to a conclusion to fix the bugs that make him strong. Yes we had the same exact problem with a lot of heroes in the past (Void's Chrono lasted 0.5 longer and Void had big advantage).

http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=98504
First of fix his starting damage. Undying's starting damage is 35‒43, instead it should be 32-40, for a guy who spams decay and gets ton of HP and damage, 35-40 is too much.

Tombstone spawns zombies from illusions, and if you ever got into a situation like this, a swarm of zombies will arise from because of the illusions, which it shouldn't. Also zombies don't disappear when the illusions die, that's why always a horde of zombies are chasing you.

http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=50383
I know that everyone experienced this, even after Undying became popular. Zombies from Tombstone always chase, even you go into the Fog of War. The problem is that they do not lose vision of you and still chase you. They should die once you go into the fog of war.

Zombies in Dota 2 stronger because of an existing bug, compare to Dota. Deathlust debuff of one zombie stacks instead of refreshing the duration (it should only stack with the debuff of other zombies). This means that zombies slow the hero more than intended and deal more damage.

http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=96926
In Dota, whenever Undying was under Flesh Golem, a unit/dying in it's AoE, you would see a dead skull flying towards Undying. Yes that is the heal. In Dota Flesh Golem's heal has a projectile with a speed of 600, while in Dota 2 it's instant. This is why Undying can sustain so much in team fights and makes him hard to kill.

http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=135633
Another problem with Flesh Golem is that Undying heals too much from the intended. Not only Flesh Golem's heal is instant in Dota 2, but in fact it heals to much.

I hope this reaches the community. It's not about Undying being nerfed. It's about the existing bugs that make him so strong.

TIFU - Shark Touch Tank Accident -NSFW,135,4vdw36,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4vdw36/tifu_shark_touch_tank_accident_nsfw/,266,1469911352.0,"So to start with, here's the obligatory ""this actually happened about 4 weeks ago"". Using a throwaway because some people here know me.

4 weeks ago, it was a friday night, I had just turned 19 and my friends and I were going to go spend the night partying to celebrate. One of my best friends works at the local aquarium and the plan was to meet up with him there after he got off from work.

So we get there around 8 pm after the place has closed and he says we can chill out inside while he finishes a few last things. The aquarium has one of those touch tanks where you can pet stingrays and other cool sea critters so we hung out there while we waited for him.

Now I had been to other aquariums before and seen touch tanks but this one was definitely unique. It was very large and has a ton of different species. Everything from hermit crabs to flounder to even a few small sharks. We started poking everything we could, probably giving half the creatures PTSD but once we saw the small sharks we forgot about everything else. There were two. Each was about 2 feet long. They were swimming around in slow circles like sharks do, like they were hunting for something.

Interestingly, they didn't really react when we touched them. They just kept on swimming as if nothing had happened. So since they weren't reacting that much, we started daring each other to do crazier and crazier things to see if they would react. This is where things went wrong. I should probably add that we had pregamed a little so we weren't completely sober.

It started with one of my friends tangling his hand in front of the shark, first for just a instant and then for longer and longer. Then my other friend upped the anti by sticking his tongue in the water. This guy is probably the craziest guy I know. About 5 years ago we used to be really close but we have since drifted apart. But for old times sake, I had called him up the day before and asked him if he wanted to hang out.

So what was so crazy about sticking his tongue in the water? Well he had just gotten it pierced that afternoon and it was still a little bloody.

Now, I know you probably now think you know where this is going, but I promise, you don't.

So he sticks his bloody tongue in the water and the sharks IMMEDIATELY stop their slow circles and start heading his direction. We all start yelling at him to get his tongue out, but he's just laughing maniacally like the joker and tonguing the water like its a girl. He waits till the last instant, till the sharks are about a foot away and then he stands back up. He then looks at me and said something like ""your turn!""

Well I had just been called out. Any other time, I would have laughed at the ridiculous of the situation and gone to see what was keeping my friend but like I said, we had been pregaming and I was not thinking straight.

So I did the only thing I could think of to top that. I waited till the sharks had swam a little ways off, unzipped my pants and dropped my dick in the water. Your birthday, in front of your friends, is not the time to start acting like a pussy right?
So I kind of twirl it around in the water, waiting for the sharks to circle back around and get close. My friend has waited till they were a foot away, so I felt I needed to wait till they were maybe 8 inches away.

My dick is kind of stirring of the bloody water and the sharks sense this and start heading back. They get closer and closer. Suddenly, when they're about 15 inches away, my other friend who were waiting on walks back in. In that instant, I looked up and the sharks lunged for my dick. One shark actually ended up biting into the first one, but the first one got almost its whole mouth around my dick.

I won't go into the gory details except to say that I had always heard on TV that shark's teeth are curved backwards to make it impossible for prey to escape and the TV was not lying.

At the hospital, my foreskin was so shredded that they ended up just cutting it all off.

Four weeks later, [this is what my dick looks like](http://imgur.com/a/nbESD)(3 pictures)

TL;DR: Get drunk and stick dick into shark touch tank at aquarium. Dick gets bitten by shark while distracted. ",controversial_subreddit,0,2016-07-30 15:42:32

At least 25+ free things Riot gives us that they didn't before. Literally MILLIONS of $$,0,31u4dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/31u4dz/at_least_25_free_things_riot_gives_us_that_they/,382,1428466182.0,"[Bull. Fucking. Shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/31t2ng/oce_player_calling_riot_out_on_their_bullshit/) Riot won't say it, but I sure as hell will.

##Riot **IS** giving us tons more stuff than ever before ***for free* when they could've sold it for massive $$**, but players just take it completely for granted!

All the while we bitch and moan like this, and they say nothing. They just take it and choose to keep giving us better, cheaper, FREE things which makes us complain *more* and demand *more* and yet they keep doing it!



* Have you ever gotten a free, completely awesome skin just because it was the World Championships or because you successfully hit Gold for the season? **FREE AWESOME SKIN**, not some ""shitty recolor"" - 
* Have you ever been to a gaming convention where Riot is? They give out tons of awesome [role-specific **lanyards**](http://tagatuci.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Role-Lanyard.jpg) (which lots of people took ALL FIVE of), PLUS (often multiple) free **skin-codes** for you and friends, plus [HONOR **PINS**](http://images.ttcdn.co/i/product/300/0/95745-5061f77abbfb4ca2a23df3a670b0f480.jpeg), plus tons of banana/bomb/cupcake/poro **stress balls,** plus **T-shirts** of all types, plus role-specific **bracelets**, - hell, at Worlds when I went they gave us FREE [**COLLECTIBLE EZREAL STATUES,**](http://36.media.tumblr.com/5209827c28e29f6c422c1f5dde678ecb/tumblr_mu80etsoEK1rn3500o1_1280.jpg) the quality kind, probably just because they had money to burn so they decided to give it to *US*! And guess what? *All that free swag sells for insanely inflated prices online.* They could make a TON of money from it if they were greedy.
* Riot gives out FREE PRIZES for tournaments via simple sign-up, and last time I checked they *increased the amount of free RP given out*! (A sum of at least **$1,250 worth in RP spread across 25 players** *PLUS* a free tournament exclusive-skin for every single tourney (even if it's TINY w/ only 8 teams)! And, they help handle disputes of un-fairness when they are involved, and help promote/market these events, etc FOR FREE.)
* Edit: People are missing this. Riot did put **tens of millions of dollars** into **eSports productions** years ago and for years at an extremely high risk. 5, 6, 7 years ago do you think any investor would truly believe that a game could sell out US stadiums, bring in millions of int'l viewers, show up on TV channels, turn into a whole other sport, etc....? No, or else other people would've done it too. LoL is not the first competitive game... & there was a definite chance that this went horribly wrong. It's great that it worked out and it's profitable now, but holy crap last time I looked watching the LCS, looking up team stats, VOD's, extra pro vids/events/exposure/interaction, etc. is still free lulz. *Why?* Because they're not greedy, they do want to do something fucking awesome for the players (because they are players too), so they poured this money in hoping someday it would pay off. Oh and last time I checked they give out **millions in prizes** during Worlds--don't tell me they *HAD* to give away that much money.
* They have ***increased* the quality** on new champions and skins, often simultaneously **lowering** the prices. Compare Bard vs. Sivir
* They let anyone use their **Intellectual Property** for FREE, so long as it's ALSO free! Holy cow, it's like Riot wanted really cool shit to be free for everyone! Besides, have you *seen* Etsy? Tons of people *DO* use their IP for profit, against their will, and yet they are not prosecuting or threatening to sue every person, just to make it stop.
* They try so hard to give the community ways to shine, doing **interviews**, **news videos**, **summoner spotlights**, creative **contests**, etc. all at costs to them with no real profit (cooking and art contests, professional-looking videos, etc.), giving out prizes like **pricey electronics** on top of a hoard of RP.
* They do awesome things like the **URF-Itational videos**, the **dressing up,** the **effort in the accents**, the video clips of **ham going into servers**, the **art,** EVERYTHING, *FOR BLOODY FREE*!
* They are completely re-designing all of the older champs, cosmetically, gameplay-wise, and more. FOR FREE. WHILE they continue to provide REGULAR content (new champs, skins, etc.). How do you justify that, if Riot is greedy? Trust me, people would play and buy old champs even if they were not completely overhauled.
* Did you notice that you get new animated champion/holiday-specific **login-screens** with custom **music** *all the time, for free?* That definitely didn't exist way back when.
* They actually **update *old skins*** to increase the quality of them to match what they're putting out now. Think Morgana's particles!
* Ever been to the weekly LCS studio? These games happen *weekly* and yet they continue to give out ridiculous amounts of **free stuff**. I guarantee you that the $15 price to get in could be easily turned to profit by ebay'ing what you got.
* Did you notice that if you buy the URF **chibi figure** you get another random one *FREE*? Do you really think they had to do that to be profitable...? No. They could've made it half-of, even. But they made it FREE.
* Did you know that they often send free Teemo hats, T-shirts, **swag**, etc. for FREE to new community groups in countries where LoL is just starting to bud, just so that they can encourage it to grow?!
* They offer *more* and *more* content for free like **custom summoner icons** just for being good or because of the season, or just because you ""mastered"" a role, *just because*... Wait, no, they can't make any money off of that.
* *LOADS MORE,* because this was literally just what I could think of by memory, off the top of my head!

Of all things, Riot did not do this out of *laziness* or *greed.* If they were greedy, they would not do recolors--their time is much better spent on things that are much more profitable and important. Also, have you considered that maybe they have to price them this way because the time that a Rioter spent on this (even if ""easy,"" [but ask any professional, it's not](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/31t2ng/oce_player_calling_riot_out_on_their_bullshit/cq4udti)) could've been spent on something else much more profitable? But maybe, just maybe they thought it would be an awesome-enough customization that it's *worth taking the hit* in production, *just because they want to give us what we've been asking for.*

---

TLDR; Riot gives us ***A SHITTON of free stuff***, more than ever before, ***literally hundreds of millions of dollars,*** but it's taken for granted. The more they give, the more players beg & complain & just expect more. *But they still keep giving.* 

**If you don't like it, just don't fucking buy it. After all, they give out enough free swag that you really don't have to.**
  
Edit: /facepalm Somehow people missed the point I was making, I probably said it poorly. No problem with disagreeing with pricing, quality, free stuff as marketing, etc and so forth. But don't act like anything you consider ""easy"" or ""small"" should be given to you for free right NOW, or else Riot is horribly screwing over every player intentionally. ... If this is the case, all summoner icons should be free, some of the low quality skins should be free, some of the low quality/underplayed champs should be free, some of the simpler ward skins should be free, etc. cuz IMO they were easy to make, are small things, and it doesn't cost Riot anything to make them free.... Why aren't people rioting about that? O_o

---


BTW, Why I don't think Chromas are ""easy"" to make (just an example):

* Riot team meet to decide which champ to recolor, what colors to choose
* team meet to decide who has time/free workload/skills to do this recolor, artist + web/marketing + engineer + tester(s), can't be the same guy every time because boredom
* artist has to stop/pause/halt current projects, emails, etc to start recolor
* (artist/engineer/web/mktg/tester gets interrupted by email, or pre-scheduled meeting, or other (trust me), has to pause + resume)
* artist finishes, creates [pretty presentation graphic](http://www.newsoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/resize-1.png)
* artist sends grfx to web/marketing team, new textures to engineer
* web/marketing write post for PBE release, uploads grfx, etc.
* editor reviews post for PBE release
* engineer codes package into the store
* engineer sets up texture
* engineer/tester tests all 3 recolors
* team meet/announcement to make sure every1 knows about this (support, PBE staff, etc.)
* web/mktg/community mgr public PBE release announcement
* engineer posts store pkg/texture to PBE 
* community finds out some mistake was made, or they want dif. colors, or jagged edge looks ugly
* support/PBE/community mgr evaluates what to tell player base, promise fix, etc.
* team meet/announcement to decide which recolors to fix, which to leave, etc. again who to assign
* artist fixes
* engineer re-uploads
* web/mktg/community mgr respond that it's fixed
* testing is good so it goes from PBE to live via patch.
* MASSIVE stress testing, potential bugs discovered, more complains/fixes/changes requested
* support has to field 100's of tickets on the things above like ""can u switch the colors around""

I was about to sell my alpha set for money (1350$) and this money would really help me...                          
They just took it, the discord admin was supposed to be a middleman.                                  
I gave the middleman the items, they proceeded to ban me from discord so now I don't know what to do.                       
guys I need some help, my life just turned upside down ...                         
chat with markydooda: http://i.imgur.com/VwopBnQ.png                                
marky proceeded to a discord call with me while I was crying he was laughing, he finds this whole scenario amusing that he is using his name to stomp on a nobody like me.                                         
i will kill myself tomorrow and the blood will be on his hands                                      
the discord admin currently has the alpha set and he refuses to give me back.                             
help me guys, you are my last hope                             
                                       
edit 1:formatting 

edit 2: this is not a debate whether or not he did it, marky has scammed me and he is proud of it, he is not even denying it. help me show him that even that I am a nobody, that does not give him the right to stomp me. alone I am nothing but together we can face him.        
marky's profile: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070673430/

edit 3: I appreciate everyones support, I never imagined it would come to this point. about sfex - marky's excuse to scamming me is that his friend got scammed by a known scammer (which is an entirely different steam account) so in his eyes it's okay to scam me if his friend got scammed. I have nothing to do with his friend, I haven't heard his name nor talked to him.                            for those of you thinking I am overreacting, you don't know what it's like living week to week, being in debts. I was counting on this $, I needed it. all marky did was act as if he were to buy it just to scam me, I don't care what excuses he has to ""justify"" scamming me, I don't know why he picked me, maybe it was because I was the only guy selling the complete set at the time on discord but he used his name in the community to ruin me, then straight up laugh about scamming me on discord.

This subreddit has an issue with using the downvote button correctly...,25,3r75kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3r75kw/this_subreddit_has_an_issue_with_using_the/,231,1446462787.0,"Hey there. In this community, we all try to get along, we all have our differences and opinions. That's one-hundred percent fine. In fact, it's what makes this subreddit an interesting place to be in.

However, a lot of the users of this sub need to learn how to appropriately use the downvote button. Let's take a look at the the downvote button, and what it is and isn't.

I frequent the 'new' and 'rising' sections of this subreddit, just to see if I can help out any new or unsure players in their Destiny journey. The fact that anyone can ask a question is excellent, and is the reason this subreddit is reputed for being nice and friendly. However, if within 5 minutes a post is at a 33% amount upvoted with zero comments, there is an issue with the userbase.

The downvote button is not a disagree button. It is not something you use in a debate with difference of opinion. It is not a tool to bury a question posed by a new player. In fact, in the comments on any post here, hovering over the downvote button will give you the text box 'Does not contribute to discussion.'

This shouldn't need to be explained, but here's an example anyway. If someone has made a post asking about good Crucible Pulse-rifles, and someone comments ""I like turtles,"" then that can be downvoted (although because of the current use of the downvote button, it will probably stay). If someone comments ""I prefer the Nirwen's Mercy over The Villainy,"" and you disagree, you **cannot downvote this**. It is inappropriate use of the downvote system. Commenting your opinion is fine if you disagree, this is how discussions with other human beings work, for example ""I actually really think The Villainy beats the Nirwen's Mercy in every aspect,"" is a fair comment due to opinion. Just because someone does not look into hidden Aim-assist values, archetypes and dps numbers does not mean they are liable to be downvoted into oblivion. Please use the downvote button appropriately, not as you see fit, because what you may see as fit may not be how it is supposed to work.

TL;DR - The downvote button is used to lower posts that do not contribute to a discussion, not because you disagree or are feeling petty. Please use it appropriately.

EDIT: Hey it's getting early over here in Middle Earth. The points are having an interesting battle of attrition, but I need sleep. Thank you for sparking the discussion here, it's been great. Once I'm awake I'll continue to participate in this thread. I read all the comments here tonight, it's really been great (in an observant way). Thank you.

EDIT 2: I awake, not caring about the amount of upvotes, but see that half of the comments are made either in jest for very ironically. Clearly the point has not gotten across. If I could make a Reddit-wide PSA to not downvote everything you see I would, but thought my most frequented sub could use a reminder. Both happy and disappointed with this sub this morning.

Regarding the minute silence at the Liberty Stadium,97,22xnlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/22xnlj/regarding_the_minute_silence_at_the_liberty/,574,1397409516.0,"Bearing in mind that all games this weekend kicked off 7 minutes later than usual in commemoration of the Hillsborough disaster, I do not feel that Chelsea have any excuse for the behaviour of their fans today.

After a delay a day a timely announcement of the stadium sound system, our minute silence today was overruled by Chelsea chants coming from below the stands in the away concourse, with a least a hundred people not coming up to their seats. This was a respectful moment not only for those who died in Sheffield, but also for a young boy who died this week in Swansea. 

~~Your fans and your club should be ashamed.~~ **PLEASE READ ADDITIONAL EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION.**

**Edit:** At the time of writing, this post stands at 18 upvotes and 17 downvotes. If you downvoted all of my comments without having been there or having anything reasonable to the contrary, I consider you an enabler and a disrespectful piece of shit, because I don't know why else opening a dialogue on the issue needs to be hidden so badly. I don't care if you don't like it, because I can guaran-fucking-tee you that the families of people that we were trying to pay respect to today would have liked what happened today far less.

**Additional edit:** The majority of Chelsea fans respected the moment impeccably and did nothing to deserve scorn. I am not pointing the finger at every Chelsea fan, merely stating that as footballing communities we need to deal with the anti-social behaviour among ourselves. By being ashamed, I mean that Chelsea fans should feel a need to make sure that they make their feelings on such behaviour vocal, and not turn a blind eye to it, as must we all in such incidents at our own clubs. Being ashamed does not mean feeling like you are to blame, but rather that you can do something to try and help it by distancing yourself visibly from such actions in order to show others that it is not acceptable.

**Final edit:** The general theme of posts coming through to my inbox at this point is a mixture of 'everyone picks on Chelsea' and 'OP you are a crybaby'. Well done, you've really shown how sensible you can all be in a discussion. And that's without talking about the block downvotes currently going on in the comments.

We've been getting a steady stream of questions about this one particular topic, so I thought I'd clear some things up on a recent decision we've made.

For the underinformed, we decided late March to ban Richard Lewis' account (which he has since deleted) from the subreddit.  We banned him for sustained abusive behavior after having warned him, warned him again, temp banned him, warned him again, which all finally resorted to a permaban.  That permaban led to a series of retaliatory articles from Richard about the subreddit, all of which we allowed.  We were committed to the idea that we had banned Richard, not his content.

However, as time went on, it was clear that Richard was intent on using twitter to send brigades to the subreddit to disrupt and cheat the vote system by downvoting negative views of Richard and upvoting positive views.  He has also specifically targeted several individual moderators and redditors in an attempt to harass them, leading at least one redditor to delete his account shortly after having his comment brigaded.

Because of these two things, **we have escalated our initial account ban to a ban on all Richard Lewis content**.  His youtube channel, his articles, his twitch, and his twitter are no longer welcome in this subreddit.  We will also not allow any rehosted content from this individual.  If we see users making a habit of trying to work around this ban, we will ban them.  Fair warning.

---

As people are likely to want to see some evidence for what led to this escalation, here is some:

>https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/590212097985945601

We gave the same reason to everyone else who posted their reaction to the drama. ""Keep reactions and opinions in the comment section because allowing everyone and their best friend's reaction to the situation is going to flood the subreddit."" Yet when that was linked on to his Twitter a lot of users began commenting on it and down voting this response alone, not the other removals we made that day.  Many of the people responding to the comment were familiar faces that made a habit of commenting on Mr. Lewis' directly linked comments.  That behavior is brigading, and the [admins have officially warned other prominent figures for that behavior in the past](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1iqdc4/civilized_discussion_and_levelheaded_moderation/cb7eaul?context=1).

>https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/588049787628421120

This tweet led the OP to delete his account, demonstrating harm on the users in this subreddit.

>https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/585917274051244033

After urging people to review the history of one particular user, this user's interactions became defined by some familiar faces we've come to associate with Richard's twitter followers.  (It isn't too hard to figure out.  Find a comment string with some of them involved and strange vote totals.  Check twitter for a richard lewis tweet.  Find tweet. Wash, rinse, repeat.)

>https://twitter.com/RLewisReports/status/590592670126452736

I can see three things with this interaction.  Richard tweets the user's comment. Then the user starts getting harassed.  Finally, the user deletes their account.

---

Richard's twitter feed is full of other examples that I haven't included, many of which are focused exclusively on trying to drum up anger at the moderating team.  His behavior is sustained, intentional, and malicious.  It is not only vote manipulation, but it is also targeted harassment of redditors.

To be clear: **TheDailyDot's other league-related content will not be impacted by this content ban.**  We are banning all of Richard Lewis' content only.

Please keep comments, concerns, questions, and criticisms civil.  We like disagreement, but we don't like abuse.

Thanks for understanding and have a good night.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-04-22 01:51:28

**EDIT:** For you who actually don't play zed, please don't claim that he is in a good spot. 

**EDIT2:** Make the delay scale with R ranks 1/0,5/0. the delay is quite healthy early when people can't get zhonyas/qss but later on it just straight up sucks with delay

**EDIT3:** Zed was a very healthy assassin pre-nerf even stated by riot and had alot of counterplay (qss, zhonyas, armor, mobility, unvulnerables, untargetables and cc) this was even recognized by top tier teams as they don't find the risk/reward of picking him worth it

**EDIT4:** Zed main's generally share the same opinion like Azoh has explained very good [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKHbH61oKjY) 

**EDIT5:** Incarnati0n's zed game is how he feels every game and Incarnati0n is an amazing zed player.

What is happening in this subreddit?,9,5a09xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5a09xt/what_is_happening_in_this_subreddit/,393,1477745038.0,"I am fairly used to the overbearing amount of troll negativity on this thread, but since this August 27^th event, it has been just stupid. The first day after, I scrolled down the entire first page of submissions, and not one substantive or even neutral submission could be found. I think that's pretty sad, because hate or love what they did, it certainly warrants an interesting discussion. 

Here are some of the genius points that made it to the top of the heap: 

* **I cannot plug my iPhone 7 into my new MBP:** That is as relevant as saying I cannot put my diskette into my electric shaver. That is neither mind boggling nor weird. The last phone that needed to be plugged into a computer was the iPhone 3G.

* **Apple priced me out, I am switching to Microsoft and getting a Surface Studio:** Never mind that Apple was always on the upper end of expensive, this one is truly mind numbing. First, inflation adjusted this is far from the most expensive MBP Apple has offered, but that is not even scratching the surface. The cost of ownership of Apple laptops has been shown over and over to be very competitive. Lower maintenance costs, high life expectancy and high residual values actually have made Apple laptops often cheaper than much of the competition during the time of ownership. And just as a side comment, the Surface Studio is more expensive than a MacPro, like twice as expensive than a 5K iMac and makes the new MBP look like Apple priced it to compete with the Raspberry Pi. 

* **Touch Bar is like the most gimmicky thing ever:** These must be the same people that complain about touchscreen phones. I mean it is just astounding that in 2016 people violently defend the notion of static function keys over an intelligently adaptable, multi touch screen. When I type a Zip code on my iPhone, I am glad when I get the NumPad keyboard and **NOT** the QWERTY, and on the flip side, I still get mad when I have to type in my credit card number and get the QWERTY keyboard. It's annoying. That is why digital keyboards on smartphones are genius. Smartphones can display the appropriate keyboard for the task! That makes sense and very shortly after 2007 has become the universal standard. If you want to go back to a BlackBerry Pearl (not a bad phone, by the way) you can, but I like multi-touch screens with adaptable software that uses the bottom 50% of my phone more intelligently than simply having static, plastic keys like in an old ass BlackBerry that can never change, and never adapt to anything. This is no different with TouchBar. Sure, typing is better on a physical keyboard, at least until haptic feedback is a little more advanced, but the function keys are surely an obvious place to start reclaiming a lot of real estate and making it smarter. It's not quite like reclaiming the bottom 50% of BlackBerries back in the day, but that is still a large strip of computer that is now inarguably superiorly used. You can still have the TouchBar mimic your old, static function keys, but to also make it this totally adaptable interface for the software you are using is actually really smart and the demos only showed a first attempt of what developers could do with it. This technology will absolutely make life easier and better. 

* **Nothing in Apple integrates anymore, nothing just works:** The usual example cited is that you need a dongle for something. I mean in a time when I can start writing an email on my iMac, continue on my iPad when going to the bathroom thanks to continuity, copy a relevant picture I find on my iPad, paste it back into the email on my iMac after my defecation without skipping a beat and in the meanwhile iCloud has synched every file, every contact, every Wifi password, every other password, my calendars, to-do lists, photos, videos, music, and made freakish backups of all of my devices that even restore the very website I was on to find that picture while pooping with my iPad should I have accidentally dropped the iPad into the toilette and destroyed it, requiring a new purchase, the statement that nothing works together in the Apple ecosystem anymore is just wonderful. 

There, I put into a million words what I have been thinking about this subreddit for a while now. Not sure what I tried to accomplish, but I feel better.",controversial_subreddit,0,2016-10-29 07:43:58

I know C9 and FNC are in the same group but I hope they both make it out. OG is looking amazing and CLG can still make it out of groups pretty handily, It'd be awesome to see 4 western teams in the final 8.



Edit: yes I made a shitpost 8 days ago that called NA a wildcard region (the post was mostly about tsm tbh). I'm saying EU vs NA is dead now, not 8 days ago. Also the reason I even thought to post this was when i realized that i was happier C9 went 3-0 after being told they would go 0-6 than if FNC had gone 2-1.

Mentally weak LCS players in Soloqueue,76,3r8kvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3r8kvo/mentally_weak_lcs_players_in_soloqueue/,599,1446487357.0,"Last night on froggen's stream, Piglet and his support xPekcake both decided ""I'm done"" and started trolling a game they were winning minutes earlier. Piglet (kalista) would ult the supp, who on very low health, would go right into the enemy team and instantly die. Piglet follows up by walking right into them so the game will end faster. Froggen said they had a ""sh$#tty mentality"" and says that he understands now why it ""all went downhill for them [Liquid]"".

This was about an hour after Adrian (TSM Picaboo) fed hard in bot lane and afk'd from the game (this happened on Valkrin's stream). Valkrin felt compelled to report him (ofc probably won't do anything). 

It's just really annoying to see LCS players who can't even handle soloqueue. I see this kind of crap all the time in silver, but never expected to see it from the pros. I think it's telling that both Valkrin and Froggen were salty enough to report/mute these players. If you watch either of their streams, you will see these guys have a very strong mentality and are not easily swayed by the stuff that happens in solo queue. Very disappointing.

He afk'd and came back a couple times if I remember so I am just going to source the report.

Btw, Piglet was out of the game less than a minute. Dunno how the idea he was getting ""ddosed"" started but even if that were true it wasn't much of a ddos. Still doesn't justify what he did as the reason he gave up was because the rest of the team didn't group with him when he wanted (froggen alludes to this himself).",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-11-02 12:02:37

he doesnt use mana, uses a new resource called magma which is simialr to energy

his q pretty much fires a beam of lava and hits first enemy champion and gives em a scorched debuff, you can recast q to dash to anyone with a scorched debuff ( it dashes to one person and if another person has the debuff it jumps to them automatically ) 

his w has a passive that lets u do bonus dmg to enemies w/ socrch debuff. 

his w active knocks all enemies around him back and pulls them back slowing them for 40/45/50/55/55% 

his ult rapidly shoots out lava, the number of shots depends on how much magma you have

his ult has no cooldown but u need to have a required amt of magna for it to activate

This is a place to share all of the work you've done or found around the internet in the past week with art aficionados like you.  Cosplay, fan art, literature, stuff you baked, this is all allowed in Fanstuff Friday, **as long as the subject of the piece has to do with League of Legends.**


**This week's theme is BEST FRIENDS FOREVER!** 

Let's keep the creativity going!   

Same rules apply as always:

----

* Anyone can post anyone else's art, however you must fully credit an artist's where possible.

    If we find you taking and rehosting other peoples' work, we will be really disappointed in you. If it keeps happening, you might earn yourself a ban. Be respectful to the people who created the work you're sharing.

* Art must be a serious attempt, your [5 minutes in MSPaint drawing Teemo](http://imgur.com/a/Jyz6c) doesn't count. (Even if the examples are amazing.).

    But this doesn't mean you have to spend hours just to be here in the thread. /u/John-C-Greystroke [drew this in 5 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/pmIAVdN.jpg). Just try to show you put forth an effort here and don't troll our thread.

* Art is subjective. Not everyone's going to like every piece of art, and that's fine.  Criticism and discussion on pieces are welcome and encouraged. Just don't be a jerk about it, and we're cool. 

    That goes both ways, too. Artists and writers, if someone doesn't like your work, don't let it get to you. Everyone needs to get along.

* All art must be **Safe For Work**. No posting nude drawings of champions, that belongs in /r/rule34lol. (NSFW) If it's racier than official splash art, it doesn't belong here.

***

**But will I be able to share my creations when the Friday thread's not up?**

Of course! Our rules haven't changed; you can post your work anytime, as long as it's within subreddit rules. 

**How can I find a picture I saw in a previous week?**

You can find all of our past threads by using this [search string](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/search?q=Fan+Art+and+Literature+Friday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).
 Now, let's get to sharing!

**Where can I go for more fanworks here on reddit?**

Well, you can try these:

* /r/LoLFanArt 

* /r/ImaginaryRuneterra 

* /r/loreofleague

Adam Harrington voiced 5 champions in this game one of his being the iconic Shaco and has been respected by the League community for a long time. When they discuss Ryze old VO at 4 minutes in they don't recognize Adam as a real actor and was a nobody. I feel like Riot should educate their employees more on who have worked with them in the past because Adam is a great actor and showed a lot of passion even when given 7 lines for the oldest Champions in this game. For me this shows just how Riot really doesn't give a damn anymore about others outside of their bubble and forgets that without Adam, without every person who collaborated with them or were hired by them League may have never been what it is today.

DOTA2 is pedantic about last hitting. If you're not animation cancelling, you're going to have TERRIBLE CS. Last hitting on every single champion is radically different due to radically different missile speeds, swing animation speeds, etc. 

Death timers are insane and walking back to lane takes twenty years. You have to pay gold to be able to teleport (""back""). 

In League, almost every champion has skill shots. In DOTA2, only a few heroes do. Most are point and click abilities. And you don't even get to use them much. Why?

In DOTA2, mana is so restricted there are some champions that can use one spell every five minutes or so in the early game. Have fun with that.

Yes, DOTA2 has a great replay system and you can spectate a game and hear official commentators (in tournaments) over voice chat. That's awesome. But League of Legends beats DOTA2 in gameplay.

EDIT: For those saying I left because I sucked, I wasn't great but I wasn't terrible, more average than anything at around 3400 MMR and mained Invoker/Faceless. I dislike the pedantic nature of last-hitting because the game puts such a HUGE emphasis on it.  I feel like laning in LOL is more of a duel and less of a last-hit mini-game.

EDIT 2: Scroll through the comments being written by people that play DOTA2 and you'll get an idea what a wonderful, welcoming, nice, and warm community is waiting for you over in Gaben's paradise. 

EDIT3: So here's a reply to the several hundred people saying ""3400 is shit, you didn't have fun in DOTA2 because you didn't *get it*, you need to be top 10% before you understand the game at all."" If your game is a shitty experience for anyone not in the top 10%, then you've proved my point. The game has to feel good for even the lowest 10% of your player base. Of the ten or so players I invited to DOTA2, none still play. You shouldn't need to be good to have fun playing a game, so thanks for proving my point. 

EDIT4: Sven's base mana at level one is 182. Storm Hammer uses 140 mana. His mana regen is 0.57 a second. At that rate, it takes 245.61 seconds to regenerate the mana one Storm Hammer uses. That's 3 minutes and 56.6667 seconds to regenerate the mana of ONE spell.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-06-17 11:12:46

Wave of Violence in Israel and the West Bank,0,3rxvjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rxvjg/wave_of_violence_in_israel_and_the_west_bank/,553,1446936213.0,"There has been a recent wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories.  Treating every stabbing incident as major world news has the drawback of the topic dominating the front page, drowning out other stories and spreading out discussion across several threads. Trying to select major incidents over minor ones is bound to lead to inconsistent decisions with such rapidly developing stories. Hence we believe a collective thread for all violent incidents is the best approach.  Users are encouraged to submit posts conveying recent developments in the comments section of this sticky thread.  Moderators will periodically review the comments and update this post with recent events.  **Top level comments must be links to news.**  All other submissions about these incidents will be removed.  

As a reminder, please be mindful of the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) when posting.  We'd like to remind you that calling other users shills, apologists, racists, islamophobes or antisemites are all considered personal attacks and thus against the rules.

ESAM on Smash Summit Drama,0,4cb7q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/4cb7q0/esam_on_smash_summit_drama/,751,1459186840.0,"First off, mods, don't delete this, this is actually me. Instead of going to a thread that is mostly hate comments, I would rather answer questions/doubts this way instead of reading through dozens of people blatantly shitting on me for no real reason besides favoritism.  
  
&nbsp;  
  
ANYWAY, LET'S GET STARTED!!  
  
&nbsp;  
  
First off, let's go over the qualification process to get into the Summit 2. Becuase of the whole Mememan situation last year, they didn't want just ANYBODY to be able to opt in, so you had to either top 32 at G3 or Big House, or be on the MIOM top 50. I lucked out SUPER hard at Big House in my bracket because Drugged Fox lost to Ginger the round before he had to play me, so I got to play Ginger instead (And beat him). That put me into top 64 Winner's, where I lost to Dark Atma (Sheik), beat my SFL friend Rula (Falco) in Loser's to advance to top 32 where I lost to Zhu, thus me being qualified for this event.   

&nbsp;  

Did I get lucky? Of course! But that's how brackets work and, as we say when people SD, we take those. I didn't rig the brackets, I didn't poison Drugged Fox, I didn't kick him in the balls to make him play bad, he just lost and then I got the better end of the bracket for it.   

&nbsp;  

Now, let's talk about how I GET my votes. Obviously I have a huge pull in the Smash 4 community being one of the top figureheads and ALSO a top player. I have a large following stemming from that. But...here's the thing.   

&nbsp;  

*These people watch me regardless of the game I play.*  

&nbsp;  

Wait, what was that ESAM?  

&nbsp;  

*These people watch me REGARDLESS of the game I play.*  

&nbsp;  

When I tweet that I'm on a Melee stream, a PM stream, or a Smash4 stream, they will come watch to support me because they enjoy ME, the player ESAM, and not just my Pikachu in Smash4. They aren't just fans of my Pikachu, they are **FANS OF ME**  

&nbsp;  

This is SUPER important because it isn't the ""Smash 4 community voting for ESAM,"" it is ESAM's *fans* voting for ESAM. Which is the same as PPU fans voting for PPU, or Drugged Fox's fans voting for Drugged Fox. I just have a unique advantage of my fans typically not wanting to vote for anybody else because they are primarily Smash4 viewers/followers. I don't have to worry about people that are like ""Oh man I like Hax so much but I also love Lucky's fox oh this is so hard"" because I have grown a brand and a persona on the internet (And at tournaments) that people want to vote for me for the sake of voting for me, and there really isn't any competition in that. So I got a lot of nominations that way, and also a lot of votes.  

&nbsp;  

""Pfft, ESAM's only getting votes because he has perks for voting""  

&nbsp;  

Oh, you mean like Zhu saying he would cosplay at Summit last year and also him making a Vlog about it? Or when Kage pledged allegiance to Melee Hell after the whole mememan debacle to 1) show MH that they were gonna be represented and 2) to gain from it personally. Or how about HugS that had his whole chart thing of perks for the days he was still in. But nah, just because I'm doing it it's messed up, when it is actually more beneficial for all the people voting for me because...I'm actually helping them get better.  

&nbsp;  

I make a LOT of Youtube videos to help people get better. I am currently making an in-depth Pikachu guide for Smash4, I have made videos of a ""Deal With It"" series where problematic moves/characters are broken down and shown how to beat/maneuver around them. Hell, the first one of those was AGAINST PIKACHU, I just want people to get better, and this is no exception. Of course I am in it for personal gain as well, which leads into my next topic.  

&nbsp;  

I doubt anyone actually read my Smashcapps article if they disliked me since ""ESAM is just a Smash 4 faggot who supports women"" or whatever the fuck people think nowadays on reddit LOL, so let me break it down for you.  

&nbsp;  

I started playing Smash competitively in 2005 with Melee. I was 12. I got better through practicing with my training partners, and unfortunately they weren't the better players in SFL (Seibrik and I led the pack, but I was the best of the group). I would win against the best people in SFL including Linguini, Lambchops (aka BeerMan), QDVS, Rock Crock, etc etc. Literally everyone in SFL except for DaShizWiz, but AFAIK I only played him once and it was at like...my 3rd tournament. I was on the SFL PR and I was, IMO, at least the 3rd best Samus at the time, potentially behind Wes and HugS (Although me being the egotistical little shit I was said I was the best). 2008 comes along and Brawl comes out. My training partners stop playing Melee to focus on Brawl, myself included, and we get really good at that game. Melee kinda dies in SFL and so even if I **wanted** to play Melee I didn't really have access to it. I play Melee at a couple of big Florida majors, FAST1 and Winterfest, and did pretty good (At least at FAST1, I got 13th). Afterwards I focus on Brawl way harder and it ends up yielding great success in 2010 and on as I became a national threat and blah blah blah nobody cares about this because welcome to the melee community.   

&nbsp;  

I wanted to start taking Melee more seriously around 2011 because I was already established in Brawl and I obviously really enjoy Melee, but I went to college in South Carolina which had a total scene of like...9 people, who I was SIGNIFICANTLY better than due to my history playing Melee and my Brawl fundamentals. So I was boned there, and obviously I spent more time focusing on college and occasionally attending Brawl tournaments to make money so I could eat food LOL. I went to a lot of North Carolina tournaments that ran both events, and I consistently placed 2nd under PPMD, or Dr. Peepee as he was called back then, or even occasionally I would lose sets to Twitch, but I was pretty much the 2nd best player in NC behind the god himself. Either way, I didn't have the resources to just travel up there for weekends to practice because I had schoolwork and going to tournaments in the first place put a huge strain on my time, so it was at MAXIMUM a once a month thing.   

&nbsp;  

So the main point of that shpeal was that I have had pretty much 0 opportunity to actually train in high level Melee...ever. And yet I still do pretty well at majors, especially at recent months. I have taken relevant names over the course of the past few years, such as Javi one year after he took 4th at Apex, I had beat Chillin/Nintendude at a Xanadu when they were relevant, I have beat Alex19, Alan, Squid, The Moon, Redd, and a whole slew of other people...with no consistent training partner or way to get better besides studying matches.  


&nbsp;  
When I'm at tournaments I typically enter multiple events and so at the end of the day I am super drained from exerting mental energy CONSTANTLY for like 10 hours, I don't really want to play friendlies after playing all day non-stop. I got knocked out of Smash4 relatively early at Big House (9th) and I actually felt not tired so you wanna know what I did? I played a bunch of friendlies with the NorCal guys. It was doubles, but it was actually practice with other good Melee players....for once. It was nice, and it reinvigorated my drive for Melee, which was one of the reasons I got 5th at Tipped Off (As well as Drugged Fox AGAIN getting upsetted a round before he plays me to Drunk Sloth, the Orlando ICs player. Don't worry, he finally got to me yesterday at Tiger Smash and 3-1'd me in WF and GF).   

&nbsp;  

I was actually getting into Netplay and playing it with good people I knew, but I live in off-campus housing still and my community switched to wireless internet that has no ethernet access, so it is very inconsistent. This not only affected my ability to stream and not randomly crap out, but it VERY much affected my Netplay abilities, which sucks because I actually really like netplay, but am unable to really utilize it.  


&nbsp;  
This is why I want to go to Summit so bad. I would absolutely LOVE to actually get dedicated Melee practice with really good players because I never have and yet I STILL am relevant. A lot of top players respect me and support me in this endeavor (Hbox, MacD, Drugged Fox, just to name a few) because they want to see what I can do with actual Melee practice.   

&nbsp;  

Am I gonna go 0-2? Very statistically probable, But like...everyone that got voted in last time (Kage, Swedish, Alex, Zhu, SFAT, and S2J) went 0-2 or 1-2 (Because 6 people can't go 0-2 in a 16 man bracket), with SFAT being the ONLY one to win a 1st round game....so me going 0-2 wouldn't even me unprecedented because players that **you, reddit** deem MORE WORTHY of being there....also shit the bed. It's also incredibly high level competition so going 0-2 losing to players like ARMADA and then later like S2J would be completely reasonable for ANY player, regardless of if they were 13th in the world or currently 81st in the world (And the only reason I'm so low is because I had a smash hiatus for like 3 months at the beginning of 2015 and then focused on Smash4, where I ended up top 8'ing CEO and EVO, worth, and then the first Melee major I attended was Paragon, in *september*).  

&nbsp;  

Honestly, I don't even care if you want to vote for me or not, but at least dislike me for actual reasons and not for some bullshit that you read one time and have kept spewing out, like Reddit is prone to do. So now that that's out of the way, let's go to some evidence people will use against me.  

&nbsp;  

""But ESAM, you tweeted here  https://twitter.com/PG_ESAM/status/710641866140729349   that you don't actually care for Melee, what the fuck is up with that?""   

&nbsp;  

So, here's the thing. I am a very PR person, ESPECIALLY on my new twitter, because esports and panda and just....generally it's not a good look to be an asshole/fuckhead/someone who just blatantly doesn't give a shit about appearance on...one of the main social media platforms that exist today. BECAUSE OF THIS, I didn't really want to incite a whole Smash4 vs Melee debate on my twitter (Kinda happened anyway, oops) by giving my ACTUAL reason of ""The Melee community online is an incredibly hateful, spiteful, and overall shitty group of people that I really don't want to blatantly hate me more than they already do for being a Brawl/Smash4 player and the words I had for them after Apex 2015 when they CHANTED MELEE DURING THE FUCKING AWARDS CEREMONY FOR THE OTHER GAMES AFTER DOING IT AT 2014 AS WELL."" I actually alluded to this in https://twitter.com/PG_ESAM/status/710640886661713924 and I don't think it has QUITE got this far, or at least I haven't read anything like that yet.    

&nbsp;  

So yeah, I was trying to save face by lying and getting people to vote for Wobbles because at the time I didn't really want to get involved in it.   

&nbsp;  

Then I changed my mind because y'know what? Fuck you guys, I'm doing this not for you to like me, but for me to get better so I can actually get good at the game I love 2nd most (Next to Smash4). I am doing this Summit so I can get better and enter more Melee events and do well and learn and get better and actually get **HIGH LEVEL PRACTICE which I have *NEVER HAD ACCESS TO IN MY ENTIRE CAREER!*  

&nbsp;  

""But ESAM you spend more time on Smash4 than Melee"" No fucking shit, I'm a top Smash4 player and Smash is my job at this point and Smash4 is more lucrative to me. I make way more money playing Smash4 than Melee, so obviously at this current point in time I am practicing it more, if I didn't I would be a fucking idiot. Just yesterday I won ~800 playing Smash4, then like ~350 playing melee and ~240 playing PM. See which number is the biggest? Yeah, no shit.   

&nbsp;  

I am planning on more Melee streams in the upcoming weeks, some with Cohenski (The best SC player besides myself) but I'm not even sure if I have the cords for my XCapture 1 so it may just be an analysis stream. I will be going over Drugged Fox's probably at some point after or before Fusion 3 for an all-day training session because I'm finally out of school and I have the luxury to travel for practice now. Will I make it a consistent thing? IDK because streaming/making Youtube videos is also a big part of my career and both of those are EXTREMELY time consuming, not to mention my relationship which I obviously invest 1-2 days a week to see her.  

&nbsp;  

So listen, I am not here for you to like me. I am not here to get your votes because I doubt I have suddenly changed enough people's minds that it will actually matter. I am here for you to at least dislike me for the right fucking reasons, which is.....honestly I don't know. I'm a pretty good person, I help a lot of people, I genuinely care about both communities (Although Smash 4 more since is isn't as...awful to me), and I care about both games. Hate me for taking votes away from some other player or something, idk.  

&nbsp;  

But the thing is I'm not even doing it because I am raising a lot of money and attention to Summit from people that wouldn't have been invested to it in the first place. THOUSANDS of dollars have been used in the shops by people who are voting for me. I and my fans have helped support the Shine and Summit shops more than literally ANYBODY ELSE, and if it weren't for me that money wouldn't be there.   

&nbsp;  

If you want to vote for someone else, do it, support them, be awesome. Make them beat me. I am not doing anything unfairly, I am not cheating, I am just playing my cards correctly. If you hate me for that, you better have at least hated Kage for the MH thing and Alex for using Mango's fans to get there/HugS last year for using incentives/Zhu for using incentives and you better not have supported Mememan because that's probably the MOST hypocritical thing that could be happening rn. Are there people voting for me strictly because they like drama? Probably. Some have tweeted at me that they want ""Salty melee player tears"" but, again, we take those. I don't support what they are saying, but I can't make someone not feel a certain way.   
  
&nbsp;  

There has been a lot of wrongdoing in the community on both ends, and I understand a lot of the bitterness the non-Melee crowd has with the Melee crowd. It is seen as very closed community that is SUPER tight-knit and people that try to break the mold or fit in often get seen as bad people. Kinda like what is happening to me right now. It wasn't always this way, as 2 Brawl players, or rather, 2 players that were SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER at Brawl than Melee, then went back to Melee at some point and are now respected in the community. Those 2 being Mike Haze and Fiction. It's one of the reasons me and Mike are so cool with each other is because we've known each other for 6 years now, meeting for the first time in the MLG era of Brawl. Zero was respected in Melee when he was putting a lot of time into it, but now I feel like if he tried to go back into it, they would give him shit. But I fucking BET you that if a top Melee player were to give smash4 a try, it would be open arms. Oh wait, that's already happening with Wobbles and Hungrybox. Larry Lurr is a multi-game threat, Wizzrobe is a multi-game threat (Who the Smash 4 players love, btw), M2K, Zero, and I are all multi-game threats, but somehow I'm the one with no respect because I am the best at Smash4 and I spend more time on it? Even though Larry does that too? And I'm sure if he started taking Melee more seriously again they would be like YO LARRY IS BACK not ""Fucking ESAM trying to get into the Summit""  

&nbsp;  

So again, if you are going to do anything with this thread, at least shit on me for a valid reason...which you probably don't have any...because I'm kinda godlike. Am I as good as the other players that are in the voting phase? Not all of them, but I feel like I could beat SEVERAL (PPU, Drugged Fox if I played him again, The Moon (again), HugS, Duck, Alex (again), Javi (again), and Hax). It's not like I haven't done well at majors before, so it isn't like I am some random that is infiltrating the system. I barely didn't top 8 Beast, I top 8'd Tipped Off, I got 25th at Big House, and I got 17th at Paragon LA. I am a good player, significantly better than 99.9999% of people hating on me.   

&nbsp;  

So yeah, I guess that's it. Buh-bye~  
&nbsp;  
Edit: Another instance of random Melee hate by people that they don't perceive of being ""In the community"" is all the shit that TKBreezy got for his commentary at 5gods. His commentary was pretty good, but people were literally shitting on him non-stop, and it wasn't even constructive, it was just ""Go back to smash4"" when he originally started commentating Melee, then switched to Brawl, then to PM, and now he is a super popular Smash 4 commentator.

[A plea to Valve] Please don't kill the honest Autoexec users,175,4kzld1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4kzld1/a_plea_to_valve_please_dont_kill_the_honest/,934,1464182417.0,"Hello, everyone.

I am loopuleasa, the author of [The Dota2 Core](https://github.com/loopuleasa/Dota2-TheCore-Config-Engine) Config Engine, and I wanted to address a change in the latest [patch](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4kwyyr/dota_2_update_main_client_may_24_2016/d3ijllz?context=3) that stated:

> A key input can no longer be bound to multiple console commands, except when cheats are on or spectating.

&nbsp;

In simple terms, it means that most of the available autoexec binds that were at the foundation of more advanced and user-friendly scripting engines are now dead. This includes the [Dota2 Core](https://github.com/loopuleasa/Dota2-TheCore-Config-Engine) and [Manta](https://manta.dodekeract.report/#/home?_k=an37vc), which were two of the popular ones being used by players worldwide.

&nbsp;

**What is a scripting engine and how are players utilizing them?**

A scripting engine, is a set of txt files that are run through valves Source scripting engine (an engine on top of an engine), using the autoexec file, that can in theory control all aspects of the game UI, meaning you can use it to setup your keyboard in any way you want, a way that is user friendly to everyone, and more customizable than it could ever be through the in-game options menu.

Here are some example screenshots of my super compact layout that is available through The Dota2 Core, that many players were using and I've received many happy responses from it. If you look closely to understand these, you can see that the keyboard layout is switching depending if you have ALT or SPACE pressed, meaning you have two more extra keyboards to utilize in a compact space readily available at the tip of your fingers.

It's so much more user friendly, and it cannot be setup this way by just using the in-game menu.

&nbsp;

**Are these engines considered hacks/macros?**

Absolutely not.

We put great effort into making sure the engine translated one key-stroke into one in-game action. No instances where one button could've launched two separate game actions (not UI actions) was available. Various tricks are being used in the back-end by the engine that supports these advanced functions, yes, but in the end, the user would've still pressed something, and out the pipe on the other end in the game client only one action would've launched.

It's all about where each button is, and in what layout, and how much control you have over it, and how you can customize the placement of all the binds you need for a game as complex as Dota 2.

The in-game menu is not enough.

It's good for most folks, yet people want & deserve better customization of their keyboard profiles.

&nbsp;

**Do you think this solves the hacks/macros issues?**

There are advanced hardware functions for gaming keyboards and mice out there that can easily setup scripts with more effort, and dedicated folks will always try to shortcut their way into achieving something like that. This patch doesn't solve anything regarding that, it simply hurts the average player that prefers to control their game layout using the autoexec.

Not to mention software auto hotkeys and various other macros and tools can be setup within minutes. There's no limit there, and detecting them is a battle with the windmills.

&nbsp;

**Why aren't tournament rulesets only for tournaments?**

Why should average players that want a more user-friendly layout suffer because the rules are so strict in tournaments? 

98% of the players won't ever participate in tournaments and just want to enjoy the game while having full control over the buttons right in front of their eyes, control that is simply not provided by the in-game options menu. And how is that their fault if we just simply ask for more, and we did our own systems using the tools you provided. Why take those tools away when we created something that works better?

I remember having a discussion with DK Phobos a while back, talking about this subject and how tournaments only let you use autoexec if you hand type it on the spot. Doing something like this with something like the Dota2 Core which contains thousand of lines of scripts isn't possible, but it's fine.

Tournaments were not the target of our engine, it was the players out there, frustrated that the simple ""Man, I wish this action was on this button"" need was impossible to do using the in-game menu.

&nbsp;

**There is a need for more customization and user-friendliness.**

You could view us as modders.

Think of games like Skyrim, Fallout, World of Warcraft, Warcraft III, all of them games in which the community had an idea of an improvement, and they took it upon themselves to make it a reality. Look where that led. 

I am reminding you that Dota was a mod in Warcraft III, and it was possible because Blizzard were smart enough to offer tools to the community to play around with. I am sure you are grateful of that fact. You owe the modders, why take away and limit their tools and toys just because other kids around the block are choking on them?

We are the ""Control scheme modders"". Just to make a distinction to the other modders around the steam workshop, that are doing a great job by the way.

People just say ""I don't like the control scheme, I want something better"" and some dedicated people rise up and fill that need and people enjoy it.

Happy times in the end.

&nbsp;

**Do these provide an unfair advantage?**

Let me give you an example.

Think of Legacy binds.

There are players out there that are using Legacy binds and they are fine like that. It's their preference, and it's how they're used to playing. With that in mind, Legacy binds are such an attrocious and convoluted control scheme that they're hardly efficient at all.

The current system available in the in-game menu is miles better in terms of layout and efficiency. That's why people use it and that's why there are hardly any players at the top level that use Legacy binds any more.

Now the next step is a player that uses something like a scripting engine. Where is the advantage there? Is the player circumventing some security in the game client, does he have map hacks or downright cheats?

No.

He just has a better layout.

You can go in the in-game menu now, and put your ultimate on ""P"" instead of ""R"", and your stop key on ""K"" instead of ""S"". That's just an absurd example, but it's obvious that that keyboard layout will be far more clunkier to operate than the classic QWER.

That how us folks feel about the current QWER customization available in the game client menu, compared with the customization of more advanced engines.

People want to have the human-machine interface as low-friction as possible when playing the game. At the end of the day, it's obvious that the player's skill in the game is all that matters.

The control scheme is something that gets in the way, when in reality it should fit like a glove.


&nbsp;

I really hope people at Valve read this and understand that we're passionate about this.

*Me and other people that I've discussed with, now that we've been used to this control scheme are going to quit Dota for now. The same would happen if Legacy keybinds were removed from the game, for example. People that are used to have ""X button"" do the ""Y action"" have it in their muscle memory so much that it takes significant effort to unlearn it.*

It's like drinking the best beer in the world for two years straight, then being forced to drink the cheapest piss-water available just to satisfy your alcoholism. Most people would just quit drinking at that point.

&nbsp;

Thank you for reading.

&nbsp;

Your friendly config guy,

Loop. <3

The Entitlement Has To End,25,3ckzlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3ckzlq/the_entitlement_has_to_end/,435,1436381596.0,"Congratulations, you're upset because a great game isn't as great as you thought it was gonna be, and now Bungie owes you reparations. 

Oh wait, except they don't. They don't owe you anything except for for the game they've made. They don't owe you what you hyped yourself into thinking the game would be. They don't owe you for putting 100, 300, or even 2000 hours into the game, just like Quentin Tarantino doesn't owe you for watching Pulp Fiction for the 100th, 300th, or 2000th time.

But here's the thing: *You don't owe anything to them either*

You know why people say ""Don't like it? Don't buy it""? Because NOT BUYING something sends a much clearer message than BUYING, COMPLAINING on the Internet for months, and then BUYING THE NEXT THING. Take some responsibility for yourself, you aren't beholden to Activision, Bungie, the Destiny community, or anyone else. 

Entitlement is a huge problem with gaming communities in general, and the Destiny one definitely has one of the worst cases of it. 

So for all the people like me who love Destiny, and are on this subreddit in order to share that love with other fans, next time you see someone complaining that Bungie owes them more, ask them: Why? 

Why does Bungie owe you anything? Are you an investor? Are you a fellow content creator or game maker? Did you help in any way besides playing the game they designed? Interaction with art is not the same as contribution, and when it takes time and skill to make new levels, test new guns, and design new emblems it's not right to demand that someone give that away for free. 

Appreciate it when it happens, don't expect it to.

EDIT:
Apparently some people are taking this post as being anti-community feedback, which it is not at all meant to be. 
I'll highlight the difference using a couple of examples by u/decimalator


Frustration: Oh man, this game is great but I wish they had done this and this or this, but not that.

Entitlement: Really? All I get for playing 2000 hours since Day 1 is this emblem? I've already done all this stuff! Eff you Bungie, I want my money back.

Frustration: The crucible is nothing but Thorns and Final Round snipers these days, and auto rifles are terrible now! We need some weapon balancing Bungie!

Entitlement: Why do I have to pay $20 for the emotes, class items and shaders?? Bungie only cares about money!

Frustration: The weapons you get from Variks and even the elementals from Skolas are nowhere near as good as the weapons from VoG or CE, and the drop rate on the elemental primaries on Skolas is abysmal given the time it takes to finish compared to VoG and CE.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-07-08 13:53:16

It came to our attention that one team was trying to win in a unfair manner. 

The admin present decided to disqualify team ANTIPRO-

After the reaction from the community I personally looked into the scenario and this is what I can read from the logs. 

[42:43](https://gyazo.com/a717456acdbd6c7feab68ace9355ecd9) Dragon Knight uses pause. But during this period no one else from dire used the pause. 

[43:58](https://gyazo.com/e820081e6bbaa71d7e767f5e93801596)

Radiant (AVS) Disconnects from the game again. 

The Dire team (ANTIPRO-) Has 4 pauses and do not use any of them.

Gyrocopter and Queen of Pain used phrases like ""EZ"" and nice.

After watching the Replay, when Radiant is disconnected 

Dragon Knight writes ""No pause"" (correct)

But they still have 4 more pauses to use since no one else has used pause before. 

Therefore the decision made will stand. 


EDIT: Radiant didn't abuse pause or spam pause. They paused only once until minute 42 incident and that was Tiny's pause in minute 19 (Which lasted few seconds).
Team Radiant never wasted their pause as many are saying. This is all from Replay and logs which can be checked by everyone.

CMV: It's wrong that Fnatic only have one strategy at a time,31,3pvtla,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3pvtla/cmv_its_wrong_that_fnatic_only_have_one_strategy/,1021,1445589064.0,"When talking about the upcoming KOO vs Fnatic match , Monte has mentioned that Fnatic are good in Bo1 but struggle in Bo5 because they only practice one strategy at a time. Another thing Monte ignored is that Rekkles is as good in hypercarries as he is on utility adcs as we saw on his Jinx games against EDG and on his Tristana games against Origen. 

When EDG tried to attack Fnatic's strategy by picking away Kennen and Sivir , Fnatic were able to adapt and won pretty convincingly .

 It's true that Fnatic struggled during the second game vs AHQ , but looking back at that game , Fnatic were in control during the early game and only really struggled because they were against a hyperscaling Jinx on the hands of a great Jinx player combined with Tahm Kench. It is my personal opinion , but I think Fnatic would have won both games against AHQ if their drafts were different . In the first game they put Huni on a champion he wasn't very comfortable on and in the second game they didn't really have a hypercarry on their team and they were against the powerful Jinx+Tahm comp. 

Even back at the MSI , we saw that Fnatic did very well in the Bo5 against SKT even though the Nunu pick by Bengi cost them the last game.

Rekkles is not some one dimensional player who can only play utility champions. If we look at his history , we can safely say that he can play all ad carries. 

That is my opinion and it's mostly an answer to Monte's criticism of Fnatic having only one strategy at a time. I'm not saying that Fnatic will win KOO, in fact I think they matches will probably be pretty close. ",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-10-23 03:31:04

However as we saw effectively argued these changes were (somewhat) good for the lcs. Here is the problem for 99.99% of the players though: THEY DONT PLAY IN THE LCS.

but, what do i mean? with all the early game nerfs, simultaneously with nerfs to the superlategames of adcs, we see a game of **teamcomps**. whoever has the best teamcomp in the lcs is very likely to win. the problem is, in soloq or normals, you do not get to influence a teamcomp that much. the one guy comes in wanting to play trynd, the other wants to play vayne and the last wants to jungle vi. thats completely ok, but in a game where the most influential thing is teacomps **you lose  your options to influence the game because the game is decided by the teamcompositions picked**.

since people seem to enjoy downvoting me, to all who say that picks do not matter in soloq and you can play whatever you want: if that were so, then why do certain champions have winrates that go as low as 37%? meaning that the lose 2 games for every 1 they win over 100000 samples? i think this proves that you are pretty much wrong, if you happen to be in game with the wrong composition the odds are overwhelmingly against you.

tl;dr: before, the game was decided by the first 10 minutes, which you could influence. now its decided by champ select, which you cant influence

We are developing an anti-cheat that is better in every single way than any that exist,46,36bpgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/36bpgs/we_are_developing_an_anticheat_that_is_better_in/,564,1431915413.0,"My background is in development.

I run a design, consulting and development company. I am self-taught, but also attended school in order to see if I was missing anything. I wasn't, in some cases, I taught my professors things. I know PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, (among HTML, CSS and tons of random web/LAMP based languages) and have recently been learning C++.

I connected with a friend who specializes in Javascript and Python, and he was able to connect me to his friend who is an expert in all variations of C, among many other low/high level development languages.

He and I had coffee about a month and a half ago. Within two weeks, he and I had produced a somewhat operational base level anti cheat that would allow us, in real time, to detect people using almost any kind of cheat. It is extremely recursive, proprietary and somewhat intrusive, but with my ideas and his know how, we produced a beta version for ourselves.

We got onto a server together (not competitive), and started firing up various cheats, some before we started CS:GO, some after, in many iterations. 

In some cases before they were even toggled on, or in basic terms, while it was gathering information in order to prepare the cheat to be toggled on, our anti-cheat detected successfully 12/16 cheats that we were testing.

One of the other four was detected in less than five minutes, two within fifteen minutes, while one cheat evaded us completely. Come to find out, the final cheat was not even working, thus why we did not detect it. 

That's a 15/15 score, with one non-operational cheat (which, doesn't matter) not being detected.

After we decompiled them, we anonymously sent many of them to various dev teams over the last month or so in order for them to better detect them. We even highlighted routines they should pay attention to.

This is only the start of our tests. 

We plan over upcoming weeks to acquire many cheats, both public and private, both ""detected"" and ""not detected"" by VAC/ESEA, and decompile them to learn more about what makes some of these programs more special than others.

Last week, we were sent a higher end paid cheat. It costs more than $100. I won't list the exact price here, or the name. After a little DRM workaround to run it freely, our anti-cheat detected it instantaneously.

This is a cheat that we've seen multiple people in their forum post statements like, ""Been using this in both PUGs and MM for 6 months, not detected,"" while we were able to almost instantaneously discover its use.  To be honest, most of the cheats are completely basic and the developers are unskilled, but in some cases, these cheats are pretty advanced and made to replicate humans in every way.

This completely undermines VAC and Overwatch, since only some of the most private ones can do this, and VAC only detects listed cheats, and most Overwatch cases won't necessarily convict the better cheaters since the replication is so near-perfect.

The issue is that VAC will not, can not, and may not ever detect many narrowly distributed and privately built hacks. That statement is based solely off the way VAC works in its core, and any more information about that you can dig up on your own.

So, you may be wondering... what are our plans for this?

* I hope that we can create a very small, affordable ($1-3/month or similar) subscription to this anti-cheat

* I hope that we can find a way to partner with the game developers, and manage this using the resources we have combined with their infrastructure

* Hopefully, through this partnership, our software can notify Valve/ESEA or whatever companies partner with us, of detected cheaters

* We hope to find a way to have the cheat do score monitoring and be able to detect statistical anomalies, and run certain routines to detect further undetected or new cheating methods based on detection routines we've written

* In the end, it will require an opt-in, and it's more likely that future games could be built around partnerships and this premise, but we hold hope that we can adopt it into the CS:GO system somehow successfully as well

* If all else fails, we plan on using some of our own servers in order to start a service to use this anti-cheat and provide the cleanest gaming experience for this game to date. This is literally our last resort, and least desired option. We don't want to run a gaming company, we want to help improve the experience, not only on this game, but future games as well.

I appreciate any and all comments and will answer any questions to the best of my ability without endangering our project or the progress we have made. 

I hope that this gives some of you something to look forward to.

Realistically, we're 3-6 months out from testing this with anybody else other than us, because we need to patent and protect whatever we can, as well as make sure that our anti cheat itself isn't backward engineered and can't be evaded easily. We understand that where there is a will, there is a way, so we have enlisted the help of two ex-hack creators and offered to compensate them accordingly to help us protect the integrity of our cheat detection system.

A few notes and pre-answers for some questions...

* I know some of you will be eager to offer help or be involved, we have the team members required for this, from graphic designers to support people already from the infrastructure of both of our companies, but I appreciate your eagerness to help.

* No, I won't post screenshots of the anti-cheat, and no I won't post any of the code/share decompiled code from the cheats we have.

* While we would love to just hand this over to companies like Valve when it's done, our time and effort has gone into this, so the timeframe could get extend to a point where negotiations and infrastructure needs to be created.

**What we would love to hear from you, questions you can answer for us:**

1. Would you pay $X/month for a 99% clean cheat environment?

2. Would you pay a monthly fee to Valve to see it added into matchmaking instead?

3. Would you run an anti-cheat client while running your CS:GO game considering it didn't slow down your system, streaming, FPS, or affect your game?

4. Would you rather this be optional, or required?

5. Does the intrusiveness level of an anti-cheat make you less likely to want to use it?

We have other plans, expansions and iterations of this, a web-based version, and much more. For the time being, this is all I can share with you guys I think.

Thanks again to this community, and I look forward to a cleaner, mostly cheat-free future.

Have a good day guys!

tl;dr - I am a developer. I met a superstar C/C++/C# coder. I love gaming. I love CS:GO. I got to AK ranks started getting cheated more. Pissed me off. We got hands on cheats, reverse-engineered them, sent a few to Valve, wrote anti-cheat. Our anti-cheat kicks ass. This is us sharing our progress with you, and giving you something to look forward to.

If you tl;dr'd this at least go to the numbered questions right above and leave us your thoughts.



**EDIT**: Many people are making this out like I claim to be the best C++ coder in the world. I have just started learning the language, but the person I am working with is not just learning the language. He probably knows C better than I know any of the languages I listed. I appreciate the criticisms, concerns and comments people have made, all good and bad.

I love this community, I hope that we can prove those wrong that doubt the ability of somebody to create something new and functional, just because somebody else hasn't done it yet.  I also never said anybody at Valve is stupid, incompetent or unable. I just think they have a different agenda being tasked with maintaining and development VAC, rather than a client-side more intrusive anti-cheat.

Other people point this as a post to build hype to get donations. You can mark my words, we won't be asking for donations, money, or contributions from the community, unless it's for a functional version of the end service once it's ready to be released -- or once someone acquires the technology and charges you for it.

Once again, the criticisms, negativity, positivity and suggestions are all appreciated, and I think will help us to address certain issues moving forward we may not have previously thought of. One of which is credibility, so we will likely need to find a way to contact some pro players, sponsors and organizations that we can get behind us to instill some faith into the community.

We have a meeting with a company in the Seattle area this week who saw this post and is interested in talking with us and having their developers look over what we have done and the plans we have for the rest of it. I can't promise any more updates. I expected a more positive response from the subreddit honestly, but I'm not entirely surprised either.

Those with feedback and suggestions, both positive and negative, we appreciate it. We hear your concerns. We hear your skepticism. I guess the proof is in the pudding.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-05-17 21:16:53

I'm disappointed in this community's reaction to the HoT price structure.,0,3a65vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3a65vc/im_disappointed_in_this_communitys_reaction_to/,243,1434554110.0,"I'm really disappointed in the guildwars fan base over their reaction to HoT cost. In my opinion one of the biggest setbacks of established MMOs is the cost to get started.

We'll take WoW for example, if I wanted to get my friend to play it, they would have to buy the following: Most recent expansion ($50), box set of main game and all previous expansions ($20), minimum of one month of game time ($15 online, $30 in store).

That's 85$ online or $100 dollars in store just to get my buddy started. Arenanet or their publisher have made the decision to eliminate all that hassle and trouble and provide the complete GW2 experience in a single box. Players who already own the game buy the same box to upgrade to HoT.

I can get the gripe that $50 seems a lot... but hey I spent over $50 dollars to take my family of four to a movie for two hours... I spent nearly 70$ for most 8-12 hour games nowadays. I spend nearly $400 for my monthly train pass to commute to school and work in the city... 

What I'm getting at is $50 is not a lot of money these days, especially not for a game which many of us will play for 100's to 1000's of hours over the course of a year or two with no subscription fee... 

But I'm not disappointed in the community for griping about the cost, that's fully understandable... I'm disappointed because ""veterans"" feel they deserve something more than casual players. You know what you got? Countless hours of fun in a well crafted, well made world with dozens of updates all free to the player after the simple purchase of a box. I'm disappointed in the community for feeling that Arenanet ""owes"" them something because they're giving new players the original GW2 for free. 

Arenanet is one of the better game-developers out there, they communicate, they listen to complaints and try new things to improve their game. They've been successful in a market dominated by broken promises and a giant behemoth. 

I'm not a fanboy by any measure, currently I'm not even playing GW2 due to other MMO interests at the moment. But I would encourage the community to cut back on their entitlements and to be more supportive to one of the better game developers out there that actually seem to listen to their community's feedback.

GW2 is a good game, but if we force them to start handing out free things or to undercut their prices we're going to see a drop in quality or a drop in frequency and either one of those things will not be good for our game.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-06-17 10:15:10

"I hate Sivir, and refuse to play her...but can we NOT nerf her and help weak ADCs instead?",276,3ejy0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ejy0b/i_hate_sivir_and_refuse_to_play_herbut_can_we_not/,921,1437826933.0,"Oh boy, here we go again...The ADC that sticks up gets hammered down

> On the Hunt (R) 
> 
> * Initial movement speed reduced to 30/45/60% from 60% at all ranks
> * Cast Range reduced to 900 from 1000
> 
> * Tooltip now notes ""Allies that join the hunt later on will only receive a 20% Movement Speed bonus for the rest of On The Hunt's duration.""

At least her damage wasn't touched, but people pick her for her pushing potential and the teamfight power of her ult, not her damage. I honestly can't see her being meta after this.

But there are so few viable ADCs right now, who will that leave us with? I mean, anything goes in SoloQ, especially low elo, but how many ADCs will actually be GOOD, especially in high-level play?

As if it wasn't bad enough that the ADC has less champions than any other lane, most of them can't even be used because for one reason or another.

-----

First off, let's list off every champion listed as a ""Marskman"": Ashe, Cait, Corki, Draven, Ez, Graves, Jinx, Kalista, Kog, Lucian, Miss Fortune, Quinn, Sivir, ~~Teemo~~, Trist, Twitch, Urgot, Varus, Vayne.

Marksmen who are so bad as ADC, they're better as Toplaners: Quinn and Teemo. And everyone hates them for it. Teemo isn't even an ADC, even though he's a ""marksman""

Marksmen who are sub-par ADCs, so they've become midlane poke-bots: Ezreal, Kog'maw, Urgot, Varus (and sometimes Corki)

Marksmen who are so bad, they're just unviable: Lucian, Miss Fortune. **Edit:** Apparently Lucian is strong in non-LCS regions apologies. I'm not very familiar with other regions.

**So, the actual list of USABLE ADCs is: Ashe, Cait, Corki, Draven, Graves, Jinx, Kalista, Sivir, Trist, Twitch and Vayne.**

------

Off the bat, there are only 11 champions usable in the ADC role, but many of them are just not strong enough: 

Vayne, Draven and now Kalista are feast-or-famine, and are never played in competitive as a result. They NEED to snowball or are useless. Vayne is occasionally played due to the fact that the pros can justify picking her with their mechanics, but even still, she can still be very easy to shut down.

Ashe, Cait, Graves and Twitch aren't bad, but they simply aren't strong enough to survive or deal reasonable damage, due to one flaw or another. Ashe is the strongest of the 4 by a longshot, but she is a utility ADC, and was nerfed pretty harshly twice in a row since her rework, and really hasn't been seen since. Twitch barely escapes Miss-Fortune tier on the merit that he does rarely get picked, and generally does well when he does.

This leaves us with the current ADCs being used in pro play pretty much every game. Corki, Sivir, Jinx, and Trist. And even Jinx and Corki are sometimes considered weaker picks if their team doesn't accommodate for them.

This isn't to say there's no variation in ADCs, we still do see the occasional oddball pick from the 11 good ADCs, or an AD Kog'maw, but the point is that sivir may be a strong champion, but it's not because she's strong, it's because **every other ADC in the game is so weak, that you can have an ADC that lacks damage, but has a strong utility ult and not be punished for it.**

If Season 4 Trist still existed, there wouldn't be any problem. Pick S4Trist, don't get greedy with midgame fights, get the S4Trist nice and fed and punish Sivir's lack of damage late game with an extremely safe hypercarry. I mean, we sort of see this with Jinx, but because she's immobile until she gets a reset, she can still get dove by the sivir-ulted frontline. If Twitch or Cait were stronger champions, they would use their range and slipperiness to punish and hypercarry the game.

But nah, just nerf sivir. Its just a sivir comp, you group and win right?",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-07-25 07:22:13

Click to hear about some of the things that have been keeping us busy. #2 will blow your mind.,3100,4x35a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4x35a3/click_to_hear_about_some_of_the_things_that_have/,2944,1470848482.0,"I would like to share some of the things we have been up to since we last chatted.

On the product side, we’ve been busy. Both our [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps have had [multiple releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile), and we’re proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we’re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.

We’ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we’d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We’re still in the early days, but I’m happy we’re dedicating resources to it.

As it relates to monetization, we’ve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we’ll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don’t want to compromise what’s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.

Yesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we’re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We’ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.

We’ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we’ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We’ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.

Happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.

Poll of polls are averages of the latest national polls.  Different sources differ in which polls they accept, and how long they keep them in their average, which accounts for the differences.

Projections are data-driven models that try to make a prediction of a candidate's prospects *on election day.*  They will incorporate polling data to give an estimate on how that will affect a candidate's chance of winning.  Note:  The percentages given *are not* popular vote margins, but the probability that a given candidate will win the presidency on election night.

Don't lie about me to my boss,7,3dkare,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/3dkare/dont_lie_about_me_to_my_boss/,43,1437088994.0,"This happened around 2001 when I worked for a computer company that decided to start offering web hosting.  Since the project was one of the top initiatives of our CEO, he took a very keen interest in how his pet project was going and was very responsive when anyone emailed him about any and all difficulties.  While that's usually a good thing to do for customer service, it's often not so great for the poor sales guy that gets that one customer that has issues with everything.  So on to the story..

I was working in my cube farm when I got a call from a cheery young lady looking to propel her boss' company into the information age and was looking to see what we could do to help her out.  M - Me.    CG - Cheerful Girl (for now)

M: ""Hi this is JoetheOK, how can I help you?""  
CG: ""I need web hosting for my company's website and I'm not sure where to begin""  
M: ""You've come to the right place, let's see what we can do to help""  

So that's probably not the exact wording but I do always try to be helpful to my customers so that's the general gist of the start of the conversation.  We went on to talk about our facility, how things work, the pricing and a lot of other Q&A.  In all, it took about 30-45 minutes to get everything sorted out and make her a happy camper when we ended the call (this is called foreshadowing).  She said she needed to make a couple more calls and then give everything to her boss but I should hear from her in a day or so.

Fast forward a couple of days and I hadn't heard from her so I figured I'd give her a call and find out if she was ready to go.  I actually got her on the first call (rare for sales) and at that point, we'll just call her PG for Pissy Girl because nothing that came out of her mouth during this conversation was nearly as pleasant as our initial call.  At first, I thought I'd actually gotten her evil twin but then came to the conclusion that this was in fact the same person, just on a different frequency.  Apparently, after calling us, she called a competitor who proceeded to tell her all sorts of fictitious information which she spewed upon me.

PG:  ""I spoke to your competitor and he told me a ton of lies (I don't remember what all she said but I think he got our name right.  Other than that, it was pretty much all false)""  
M:  <tries to debunk said lies>
PG:  ""He said you'd try to say that but I know better (I guess his lies were prettier than my truth?  No idea, I have a very pleasant phone voice, I guess his was just better)
M: ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but I'd be happy to go over everything and make sure you have a clear picture of what you're getting from both companies and clear up any misunderstandings if I can""  
PG: <Nothing vulgar was said but nothing complimentary at this point either.  I believe she did cast some aspersions upon my truthfulness and perhaps my parentage.  At this point, we were pretty much done>
M: ""If there's anything we can do for you, please let me know""
PG: <Click>

About 10 minutes later I get an email in my box from the harridan that I had been copied on.  I also realized that it was directed to my CEO who I was certain was going to read it.  It contained a litany of my sins, my shortfalls, my lack of ability to tell the truth, and quite possibly my severe lack of hygiene (none of which was true, especially the stinky part). I didn't realize how fast our CEO would read that but by the time I was through reading this sternly worded missive, my manager was popping out of his cubbyhole like he been shot from a gun.  He got an email, my director got one and both of them wanted to know what the hell I was doing.  Fortunately, I had a great rep on the floor and a couple of awards for being a customer advocate so I wasn't hoisted up on a stake to serve as an example for the rest of the staff.  It did, however, take a bit of telling the tale and swearing on an unopened copy of Microsoft Windows to convince them that I wasn't even half as horrible as I was portrayed in this work of fiction.

Now the revenge part.  Upon arriving to work that morning, I got a lovely piece of SPAM in my mailbox.  All I had to do to get all of the loveliest, filthiest, hardcore porn delivered to me daily was just give them my email address.  Since this was before the Canned SPAM act, there wasn't any of that pesky validation thing so with just a couple of clicks of a mouse, I made sure she was fully informed on every variation of every sexual position and fetish anyone could send her (for free even, what a bargain).  Not only had she emailed me from her corporate address, she even copied her home email so she could keep a copy of the dressing down she gave me presumably so she could cheer herself up by reading it when she couldn't find anybody in the office to have fired.  Not wanting her to miss out on her education into the ways of the world if she wasn't at work, I added that address too.  I'm not exactly what transpired at that point but knowing the wild west of porn spam at that time, I always rest assured that her email boxes were defiled and defiled and then defiled some more because once they had an address, even an act of God wouldn't get you off of it.

A note in regard to recent events,0,21qptp,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21qptp/a_note_in_regard_to_recent_events/,1056,1396181431.0,"Hello all,

I'd like to try clear up a few things.

**Rules**

We tend to moderate /r/technology in three ways, the considerations are usually:

1) Removal of spam. Blatent marketing, spam bots (e.g. http://i.imgur.com/V3DXFGU.png). There's a lot of this, far more than legitimate content.

2) Is it actually relating to technology? A lot of the links submitted here are more in the realms of business or US politics. For example, one company buying another company, or something relating to the American constitution without any actual scientific or product developments.

3) Has it already been posted many times before? When a hot topic is in the news for a long period of time (e.g. Bitcoin, Tesla motors (!), Edward Snowden), people tend to submit anything related to it, no matter if it's a repost or not even new information. In these cases, we will often be more harsh in moderating.

The recent incident with the Tesla motors posts fall a bit into 2) and a bit of 3).

I'd like to clarify that **Tesla motors is not a banned topic**. The current top post ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/21q07g/model_s_now_comes_with_titanium_under_body_shield/)) is a fine bit of content for this subreddit. 

**Moderators**

There's a screenshot floating around of one of our moderators making a flippant joke about a user being part of Tesla's marketing department.

This was a poor judgement call, and we should be more aware that any reply from a moderator tends to be taken as policy. We will refrain from doing such things again.

A couple of people were banned in relation to this debacle, they've now been unbanned.

I am however disappointed that this person has been witch-hunted in this manner. It really turns us off from wanting to engage with the community. Ever wonder why we rarely speak in public - it's because things like this can happen at the drop of a hat. I don't really want to make this post.

It's a big subreddit, a rule-breaking post can jump to the top in a few short hours before we catch it.

Apologies for not replying to all the modmails and PMs immediately (there were a lot), hopefully we can use this thread for FAQs and group feedback.

Cheers.",controversial_subreddit,0,2014-03-30 07:10:31

play all 111 champions with 5 rune pages (do not upvote),2,1cajeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1cajeq/play_all_111_champions_with_5_rune_pages_do_not/,70,1365891209.0,"NOTE: if you don't like solomid guides you should probably stay away from this list :)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AmGVinPUDJhMdDRaYjk1YXB3a2VNOE1NNUNTemJ1bEE

This spreadsheet lists rune pages and builds for all of the 111 current champions - the trick is that you only need 5 rune pages!

Obviously there is a lot of compromise, so not every champion will be at his best with this approach - thats why there is a compatibility rating. In my opinion, every champion should be playable with these runes, but the yellow ones could be a bit.... shaky :D


Another compromise is not including every possible build (ad carry jayce, ap trist and similar things) - I just included what I think is played most - it's of course possible that I forgot to include something - let me know if there is a featured or approved build for it :).


Leave feedback for me in this post :) I will probably expand this to 6 pages, then 7 pages etc. until every champion has the ""perfect"" build, but I wanted to get the baseline out first :)

**In case it wasn't obvious:** This is of course most effective if you have all champions, or are at least close to it. If you only have access to around 30 champions there will probably be other rune pages that support those champions the best. For example, it's very possible you have zero AP Bruisers - in this case that page could be used to get other champions closer to the ideal build.

#/r/HillaryClinton 

**13,003** *voters* for **3 years!**

First, and introduction from the mod team.

>>/r/HillaryClinton is proud to be featured as today’s subreddit of the day. Our thanks go out to the mods here for allowing us to feature the most experienced and most qualified candidate in the presidential race. 

>>Hillary Clinton has always been a fighter.  After serving on the Watergate impeachment hearings, her first job in Arkansas was as a professor of criminal law at the University of Arkansas. A decade later, she was repeatedly listed as one of America’s 100 most powerful lawyers by The National Law Journal.  And she kept publishing influential journal articles.  In 1992, the New York Review of Books looked at her impact on the legal profession and declared: “She is one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades.”

>>Her experience as a United States Senator, First lady and Secretary of State will prove invaluable as we face some of the most contentious times of this century. While other candidates preach fear, gloom and calls for revolution, Clinton sees the progress we are making and vows to continue and expand on the success of the last administration. She is offering solutions. Not dismal prophecies of doom. If elected she will be able to hit the ground running like no other President in modern history. 

And now for the interview. 

>#**Hillary Clinton has lead of 333 pledged delegates. Given the proportional way that delegates are assigned in the Democratic nominating process, do you see any way where Sec. Clinton does not win the nomination?**


>>The pledged delegate lead is only expected to grow but even if it doesn’t, Clinton is too far ahead at this point to matter. Since delegates are awarded on a proportional basis, huge blowouts in all of the remaining primaries would be required to even come close. Being Hillary is favored in almost all of the remaining contests, this scenario is extremely unlikely. Clinton is just too far ahead. 

>>The Sanders campaign has also suggested flipping super delegates that now heavily favor Clinton. Earlier in the campaign he suggested these delegates in each state should go to whichever candidate won that state. Even if this were to occur, Hillary would still win. The fact is no matter how you look at it, Clinton will still win:

>>* Clinton wins with the super delegates

>>* Clinton wins without the super delegates

>>* Clinton wins with the popular vote

>>No matter how you look at it, there is no real path for Sanders to catch up.


>#Let's talk about super delegates. The Sanders people despise them and feel like they're stealing democracy. The GOP seems like they wish they had them. What is the role of the super delegate, and why do you think they're needed? Or maybe you don't think that. If not, just tells us your feelings on that.

>>Super delegates are state and federal representatives, senators, presidents and vice presidents, most of who are elected by the people to represent their state. They were created to allow party leaders to prevent selecting a completely unelectable nominee such as George McGovern, who lost to Nixon in 1972 by a landslide. Even so, super delegates have never over-ruled the will of the voters. **NEVER!!!** And they will not do so this time.

>>Still the Sanders campaign deemed them undemocratic. He was adamant they should go to the candidate with the most votes in their respective states. But now that this scenario no longer favors him, he feels the super delegates should support him anyway. Regardless, these are the rules set out from the beginning. You do not change the rules of a game at half-time. And even if you did, Clinton still wins no matter how you change the rules or calculate the delegates.



>#Who would Sec. Clinton rather run against in the general election, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, or someone else, and why?

>>We can't speak for the Secretary, but we’d imagine that she'd love to run against Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, both of whom she regularly trounces in head-to-head matchups. Honestly it really will not matter who wins the GOP nomination. But it sure would be fun to watch her take down Trump.


>#Are you worried that if Sec. Clinton wins the nomination that Bernie supports might not vote for her in November?

>>[Hillary addressed that](https://youtu.be/eqfGL_iTaBU?t=3m45s) herself in a GMA interview! In 2008, Clinton supporters said the same thing. The ""Bernie or Bust"" movement is very much an allegory for the Bernie Sanders campaign in general and is quite loud on the internet and social media. A lot will depend on Sanders himself but in the end, the possibility of a Trump presidency should be enough bring the party together along with independents.

>>Sanders supporters need to be aware that if a republican wins the White House in November, it would destroy all chances for any future Sanders to accomplish anything for decades to come. With a republican win, the Supreme Court would end up with a 6 – 3 conservative court for at least the next decade. Even if a future Sanders should win, anything he would accomplish would be overturned in the courts. The Supreme Court picks is one of the most crucial things the next president be responsible for.



>#Again, assuming a Clinton nomination, do you think that there's a role for Sen. Sanders in her administration? If so, what might that be?

>>This is one of those *what if* questions that is next to impossible to predict. Clinton has not given any clues as whether Sanders will be a part of her administration, though it is doubtful she would choose him as a running mate. There could be a cabinet position he would be considered for but at this point your guess is as good as ours. It would also depend on if Sanders rallies behind the Secretary after the primaries conclude.


>#Republican candidates have been suggesting that Sec. Clinton may be indicted over the now infamous email scandal. Can you care to comment on that?

>>Republicans and Sanders supporters’  have thrown every allegation they can against wall just praying something will stick. Just like Benghazi, they will claim she is guilty even though eight congressional hearings making for the longest congressional investigation history have turned up nothing. Republicans have publicly admitted it was all intentionally done to discredit the Secretary.

>>We already know that no information was classified at the time it was sent. The FBI investigation will be thorough and will find the Secretary did nothing illegal.  The DNC had a serious of long, serious discussions with Hillary Clinton and if they had any reservations there was even the slightest of chances she would be indicted, they would've stepped in months ago. Regardless, her opponents will claim differently regardless of what these investigation turn up. 

>>Secretary Clinton has taken everything republicans and Bernie Sanders supporters could throw at her and has still emerged as the Democrats' choice to represent them this fall and we are confident she will be America’s choice to lead them for the next four years.


>#Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has been repeatedly demanding that Sec. Clinton release transcripts of her private speeches to places like Goldman Sachs. So far she has not. Do you feel that her position on this is justified?

>>Believe it or not, this entire fuss is over three speeches in which most of the money received was donated to charity. She has repeatedly said when other candidates release similar information, she will release hers. Sanders said he has released his transcripts. This is an unfair comparison because he is not allowed by law to give paid speeches. Still Sanders has still failed to release his tax returns like he promised he would. He has released only one year. Clinton has released eight years of hers which shows she and Bill had a tax rate of 35% in spite of massive charitable donations. Sanders paid only 19% tax rate in spite of donating almost nothing to charity.

>>Hillary has provided far more personal information about herself than all the other candidates combined:

>>* https://www.hillaryclinton.com/tax-returns/


>>Until other candidates release their information, Clinton will not release hers. And be assured there will be much more to see in Donald Trump’s tax returns than you will ever find in three speeches given by Secretary Clinton. She is wise to hold on to this information in order to force Trump to release his information which up to now, he has been unwilling to do.

>#I think we can all agree that Hillary Clinton is not too popular on reddit. However, she seems to be popular enough to win most of the actual votes. To what do you attribute that disconnect?

>>Reddit has been a passionate voice for important issues around the globe. Often they are in the minority but that doesn’t discourage them in the least. Being that reddit demographics are largely made up of the under 29 population, it is no wonder they would get behind the candidate of change. Older folks have seen too many calls for revolution and are not so quick to jump on that train. But in any case, reddit has served as a catalyst to bring the youth of our country into the fold of politics and that is good for everyone. 



>>In conclusion we here at r/hillaryclinton want to say Bernie Sanders supporters have a lot to be proud of. No one would have believed you six months ago if you said he would come this far. And though it is tough to come this far and not win, do not be discouraged. Change can happen. It just takes a little longer than you think. 

>>Hillary Clinton has stood the test of time. She is a fighter. Republicans have tried every dirty trick in the book to discredit her and yet she still stands tall and is ready to fight for you. Please join us as we fight for her.

>>#Hillary 2016!

In this game someone leaves the game, you get nothing for it, if you leave you get a leave status on your account.

I play my first 4 real matches last night. Each one had a ragequitter or an afker and every time that team did, they lost.

Have a good day!**

&nbsp;

This is pretty much the same story of EVERY new game. And it's ridiculous, it's hilarious how people feel entitled to say whatever they want behind a screen, how possible good criticism becomes bullshit because their arguments lack respect, I'm ashamed of being of the same species of some people these last days.

&nbsp;

I've been following this game's development for two years now, first heard of it on the E3 2014, I've saw every video, read pretty much every little bit of data about it, I've heard Sean speaking way too many times, in way too many interviews, to believe that all he's been saying so far has been lies. If you were a half decent person, you would go and watch any of those videos, and hear him speaking about developing the game of his dreams, the one he wanted to play since childhood.

Sean abandoned EA (and he had a way better job that he's been having these last years) and sold his house to develop games, Hello Games flooded, received death treats, was put under the pressure of being developing one of the most anticipated games for years, with a team of 12-15 people, working shifts of 15 hours, I don't know many developers who would do any of that, to be honest.

&nbsp;

And now, after launch, it's totally acceptable to complain if we can't see other players as it was promised, but what's the point at insulting these gals and guys? Will it make them hear you louder? All you've done these past days is burying under stupidity the wait of many users and the work of many developers.

At the end of the day, people will be people, and they'll respond violently to the most stupid problems, but mostly, this subreddit is full of worthy people, which can express their oppinions politely, and all I can do right now is thank you all for the awesome moments over these past years you've given me, you're all amazing.

&nbsp;

TL;DR: don't let stupidity get to you, express your complaints, but politely. My gratitude to all these people that has been polite during the years, you've given me a lot to remember.

&nbsp;

PS: 7 hours for the PC release!

&nbsp;

Edit: just because I see this comming: if you've paid 60 euros, it's your fault, I'm pretty sure that Sony put the price tag, not Hello Games, and it's been announced like that for a year and several months now, no point at complaining about a price tag, it doesn't make the game less indie, I'm happy to pay whatever I think a developer deserves, and this team has done more than enough to give them some money.

Edit 2: Sorry, I've lost that battle, I can't do absolutely anything about [this argument] (https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4xcsnk/as_if_programming_a_game_wasnt_difficult_enough/d6ejo80), sorry to all that expected me to keep trying to debate, I'm defeated.

Before I start of, I just want to say I'm absolutely terrible at making very long posts like this one will be. I will probably word some things badly due to English not being my first language (It's Dutch :D). 

#About my comment in /r/circlejerk.

When I posted that comment I did not think it through properly. I was having a good laugh at the /r/circlejerk's mods post and wanted to have a little fun too by joining in. 

I  copy pasted /u/GodOfAtheism's and /u/altosax29b's style of posting in that thread. 

Here is what /u/altosax29b said:

>As a moderator of /r/circlejerk, I humbly urge our subscribers to not, and I repeat, *not*, post Paul Blart-related material to /r/leagueoflegends. Let me repeat again. *Do not post Paul Blart-related material to /r/leagueoflegends.*

Following that comment I posted this:

>As a moderator of /r/Leagueoflegends, I can not thank the mods and users of /r/circlejerk enough for listening to /u/altosax29b's wise words. Your help will make sure this week will be quiet and lovely.

>Thanks to /u/GodOfAtheism for the lovely words aswell.

>Cheers

Now looking at those 2 comments further I definitely see that my sarcastic comment was misplaced. I also see why this stirred up so much drama.

I want to apologize for making this comment. It was misplaced, 

#Concering your valid points about this being brigading.

I'll try and talk about some of the valid points raised in the original thread. 

From /u/Paran014

>Regardless of how serious or not /r/circlejerk is, there sure was a lot of Paul Blart themed spam in the /new queue yesterday. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/search?q=paul+blart&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) are a couple examples. There were a lot more.

This is one of the things I did not see coming or thought about when I posted my comment. While writing that comment I did not mean anything I said. I thought I was safe from everything and anything because it's literally a sub for satire and being sarcastic. I never checked back on that comment after I posted it and didn't think much of it at all. 

I'm taking full responsibility for this mistake and will ofcourse reflect on it. I never intended this to happen but it still did which is something that should be taken seriously by me. If the community asks for my resignation as mod I will ofcourse comply.

>Are you seriously suggesting that if /r/circlejerk posted something like that while you were actively modding you'd post something funny about it while merrily deleting the endless stream of shit it prompts, or would you tell them that posting a sticky encouraging people to spam your subreddit is way over the fucking line?

I'm think that the user is trying to say that that if something like this would ever happen again if I would respond the same?

If that's the case, then no. Since that was my first time doing something like that I did not see the repricussions of posting the comment. I got caught up in the mod-free week and tried to have a little more fun then I should have. From now on I won't be posting in League related drama in either /r/circlejerk or /r/leagueoflegends. If I do decide to do it I will use a alt to make sure this doesn't ever happen again.

From /u/brodhi

>You know what the best option was? Not to open his fucking mouth. He is a moderator of a subreddit, and despite what you want he has responsibilities and an image to hold as one. Just because they are ""on break"" doesn't mean he can go willy-nilly shitposting and ""sarcastically"" encouraging brigading on a subreddit whose entire purpose is to vote brigade. The amount of kissass that goes on from some users is insane. They could bring back Hitler himself and you would say, ""LEAVE THE MODS ALONE!!!!""

This is pretty much the only correct thing I should've done. I never should've commented on a /r/leagueoflegends related drama thread and it was fucking stupid to do so. I did not carefully consider how this could influence the subreddit itself or if it was at all professional to post the comment.

From /u/smiletodie

>Richard Lewis got banned because he linked reddit comments in his Twitter.
You clearly asked for brigading this subreddit as a mod. You have a lot of followers and even if you were joking this sub got spammed with Paul Blart.

Looking at it now I feel like it can be compared to the brigading drama with Voldemort. Although I did not ask for it directly or officially speaking as a moderator it still led to brigading which is why I should face these concerns and apologize for them. 

From /u/sorenthaz

>Mods are honestly showing their true colors/motives behind the mod-free week at this point. They take it as a joke and an excuse to manipulate matters to favor their objectives (in this case, proving that we need their strict moderation).

This is not the case. This was a individual mistake and I never had any agenda behind it and I honestly think it doesn't look like that either. I never actually considered this would influence the subreddit in such a way. Honestly speaking, I do from time to time think that less-strict moderation could be a good thing for this subreddit.

#My response in the front-page thread

After I heard about the post getting upvoted I quickly tried to explain that none of it was serious

Here's what I said:

>This was posted in /r/circlejerk, a totally non-serious subreddit. Anything I say there should not be taken seriously

>Edit; Also we're not removing anything unless a post violates our mod-free week rules. ~~You can go ham on me all you want but if this is something I'm ging to be witch-hunted for you need to set tour priorities straight~~

>Did not word that as I wanted to, I'll reply to everyone's concerns when I'm home.

I want to specifically talka bout the crossed out part. I was way too agressive there as I did not realize what exactly I did wrong. I hadn't found out about the brigade actually being a fact and did not see it was much of a big deal yet. Ofcourse looking at it now that reply was pretty much the worst thing I could say.

In the replies following my comment I learned about how the brigading actually happend and how much I did actually fuck up so I immediatly retracted my statement. I'm sorry for commenting with pretty much the worst thing I could say.. :)





#Final statement.

I hope this shines some more light on the situation. I never intended it to create such a mess and will reflect on it personally. As I've said before, if the community feels that I should not be representing the moderation team anymore please tell me honestly. 

Also I wanted to say a quick thank you to the users who send me supportive messages. Thanks so much.

^^^big Sorry for everything, thank you for reading.

Today we voted unanimously to end our protest and bring the subreddit back.  We thank you for your patience and understanding.

Much has been said by many people about the coordinated black-out across Reddit.  Our participation was directly related to Victoria's key position at Reddit, not just coordinating of AMAs but also as the only admin that responded regularly to our concerns and needs as moderators.

Our sole goal with this subreddit is to provide a forum for the discussion of movies and the motion picture industry.  Unfortunately we cannot do that without a supportive infrastructure in place.  Victoria's dismissal was effectively a dismissal of that infrastructure.  As such, we recognized the need to draw attention to the issue.  

We do not consider the issues caused by Victoria's departure to be resolved, but we also do not consider a repeated blackout of /r/movies to be useful in resolving them.  We are working with the Admins and the moderators of other subreddits to bridge the gap; in the interim, we are returning the subreddit to normal.

For those of us who joined us in /r/flicks yesterday, thanks for checking out the sub.  We encourage you to say subscribed, as we view /r/flicks as a safe ""back room"" further from the default mentality.  And for everyone: thanks for your patience and understanding.

So, I've been playing this game since 2010, I was Diamond 3, I've spent at least $1000 in skins, dedicated hundreds of hours to the game - basically I cared a lot about League, and still do, which is why I am now turning to the community to help me out. 

Here's what happened: On July 9th, after not having played the game for weeks I try to log in and it tells me my account has been permanently suspended. It was banned because they believe I was found to be using some sort of third party program to gain an unfair advantage in my games. http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/20687433#profile If you look at my match history, there's no way I'm getting some unfair advantage seeing as I have about a 55% win ratio and my match history is certainly not all wins.

I live in a shared housing unit with about 5 other people. We all commute to college and happen to all play League. The only thing I can think of is that they banned all the accounts from this IP address without realizing that it's actually a lot of different people that play here. I've sent two tickets to Riot explaining my circumstance and this is the response I've gotten from Riot support.
I've taken a look at your account, and you were found to be tampering with the game in such a manner that it was giving you an unfair competitive advantage over other players. This has resulted in a permanent suspension of your account that I will not be able to reverse.

Please note this section from the Terms of Use to which you agreed:

This was clearly a copy and pasted response, and it was obvious to me he put forth zero effort in actually INVESTIGATING this situation. On July 19th I submitted another ticket pleading with Riot to investigate the matter further so that they could see it wasn't me who did this third party stuff but rather someone else that lived with me. When I submitted this ticket I managed to get the exact same person and he gave me this rude reply: Hi kKazuo,

I see your concern has been handled over in ticket #12622030; if you've no new concerns at this time, I'll be considering this matter closed as well.

I'm begging for the help of my fellow LoL players. This Riot support member is certainly not interested in actually doing his job and would rather just close tickets and move on as to not legitimately deal with a problem that might be a bit of a headache. Please help my post gain some visibility so I may have a better chance at a real investigation. 

If my account's suspension for whatever reason is not removed I at least want to see this Rioter that handled my ticket receive some disciplinary action for his unprofessional behavior

It certainly has been an *interesting* weekend, thats for sure.

As most of you know by now, the media pre-release of the first four episodes were leaked on Saturday night/Sunday morning.     

In keeping with our policy on piracy, which dates back to the earliest days of this subreddit, we as a moderation team decided that it was only fair to restrict discussion of episodes to those which have aired legitimately on HBO and its partner networks worldwide. As with any major decision, this has been met with both support and ire from many members of the community.

This decision was taken out of respect for those who have worked tirelessly for years to produce this show, and out of respect for the rights of those content creators to disseminate their work as they see fit. 
To allow these leaks on this sub, even in a restricted form, is a slap in the face to the people who create the content we all enjoy so much. 

This decision allows safe passage into all threads for our subscribers who do not want to pirate the episodes. They should not be disadvantaged by that decision. With the early release of TWOIAF in some Target stores, we took the stand that no discussion should be allowed on the sub until the book was officially released, a widely popular decision. This is the same position we are taking here. These episodes are **not** available legally, and until they are, we are not allowing discussion of their details here. 

We also want to emphasize the distinction between the screeners & early screenings and the leaks. Those screeners were meant for media outlets to prepare previews for their audiences, previews which did not reveal every plot detail.  They were distributed by HBO in good faith, and that trust has been broken. As it stands we cannot discern between someone who has legitimately seen Eps 2-4, and someone who has illegally obtained them, whereas before this leak, that was not an issue. 

Was our reaction ideal? No. We had no way to anticipate either the leak itself or the [massive influx of traffic on the sub](http://imgur.com/qYop0qm) which this leak would create (on top of the expected influx of traffic as the premiere aired). Simply put, we were caught off guard. 

We are real people, we have jobs, this is something we do in our spare time. This leak has been the largest amount of modding work many of us have ever had to do, but we do it because it is something we fundamentally believe in. 

Finally, to address some of the main points of contention. 

* **Did some people get banned unfairly?** Yes, we are fully prepared to admit this. Many of these bans have been rescinded since the furore has quietened down. Anyone who has been banned is fully entitled to seek clarification from us. 

* **But what about set leaks, interviews etc? Why were those allowed before?** There's no consensus as of yet about what the threshold for a leak should be. Is it a set photo? Is it an alleged portion of a script? Is it an extra's recounting of a scene? We've allowed these in the past and it's been used as justification for allowing the leak spoilers.
Our stance is, and always has been, that the pirated leak of the four episodes is fundamentally different to photos or recollections. We don't view them in the same category and we don't think allowing one means we're required to allow the other. 


Going forward, a new episode becomes available every week, and the size of the leak diminishes, until thankfully by May 4th, we can put this incident behind us, and move forward together as a community once again. 

We don't ask you to agree with us, we simply ask you to respect our decision. 

Yours Kindly,

The /r/asoiaf mod team.

Lee Sin Lessons,153,20qrd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/20qrd9/lee_sin_lessons/,1818,1395171175.0,"Hey everyone,
 
I read through all your replies / feedback on our Lee Sin retune, and I have made some changes! But before I get to them, I think there’s some misunderstanding to why we’re making the changes to Lee Sin and how these changes will impact him. Some of you read my posts and responded (good feedback!), but a lot just saw lower numbers and got angry (not good!). So a few things:

-

•         ***From our changes, it felt like Lee Sin’s ‘identity’ was under attack (assassin early > utility tank late / strong early > weak late)***



Changing Lee Sin’s identity was never our intention! If it seemed like that, then your feedback is good in checking us.
 
From our own understanding (and your feedback), we see Lee Sin as a risky, high-skill champion who makes really cool plays in the early game and gets rewarded for that playstyle (especially in the early game where small-scale skirmishes take place). The problem was that he had very low risk because of his raw strength in stats and abilities that even if he made a misplay, he could always recover. We are absolutely fine with early game Lee being strong and late game Lee being weaker than most, but we wanted to create real risk for Lee in the early game and, if he succeeds, give him a path forward to play in the late game. This is more true (but not absolutely driven by) competitive play, which is more focused on early power champions. Speaking of competitive, early game Lee Sin (for teams that can play him) is so strong that he often crowds out any alternative choice (because there’s very little he can’t do for the demands of competitive junglers). 
 
Late game Lee Sin is the opposite - the most frustrating part was that he lost a lot of relevancy late game no matter how well he did early game (this is important!). Late game Lee has no prolonged threat to give him a presence except his initiation (which can be very unreliable), so he has to pull off an extremely mechanically difficult play to be considered “successful,” and then he’s almost completed his job. If Lee **can’t** pull off that kind of play, he gets punished for “misplaying.” Even if Lee makes a lot of successful ganks and goes into the late game with a lot of kills, he often loses because he has no strong way to take advantage of it (unless he’s really, really far ahead). We wanted to give Lee Sin some options while staying true to his perceived power curve of being strong early and weaker late.

A summary here would be that we like champions who are strong early or are strong late, but at least part of those strengths should come from player skill and not all the champion being picked. I know Lee Sin 'feels' very balanced because all of his abilities are skill shots, but he keeps a lot of his power even when he fails, which isn't true of a lot of champions. 

-

•         ***Nobody appreciates the attack speed buffs on Flurry.***


I made a mistake in communicating this the first time, so I’ll say this: this isn’t a buff to how Lee Sin is played **right now**, but it’s a buff to how he **can** be played when he has a real late game presence. I wish I could show you how much smoother Lee Sin feels to play with these changes because it lets him get his energy back from Flurry so he can use more spells. He's also a lot 'stickier' in following opponents because he can get a few attacks out in between his abilities (and much faster). 

In late game team fights Lee Sin is very weak so he could only use his spells for damage. The attack speed buff to Flurry means he can finally deal sustained damage at all points in the game so he’s not trapped in only finding the ideal initiation window (insec play).


-

•	***Ward Hopping was too punishing.***


Once again, we like the play pattern and think it's cool, but it was giving Lee tons of frustrating mobility without real offensive / defensive tradeoffs. We're very firm on that belief! But from your feedback, it was clear that energy cost increases on Safeguard would make Lee no longer able to perform his best combo, so we've reverted it. We still need to make some kind of tradeoff here, so he'll be giving up the safety of the self-shield if he jumps to minions / wards. 

We also think it's important to reduce a little bit of Lee's frustrating mobility moments so we're also sticking with the increased base cooldown that gets reduced when you cast it on an allied champion. This also rewards / incentivizes Lee to cooperate with his team instead of being a self-sufficient monk.

-

•	***The change to Dragon's Range was too different from what Lee currently has.***


Agree. With so many changes in this retune it could be easy to see this change as just a damage nerf. In the early to mid game, Dragon's Rage is mostly used as a high damage execute and in the late game, Dragon's Rage is mostly used as a positioning / 'insec' play to isolate a target. We made this change to add more consistency in the choice while also reducing some of Dragon's Rage's really high early game power. So you would choose to either isolate a target from his/her team, or you would choose to kick someone **into** the enemy team for massive damage. This would be a choice you could always take throughout the game rather than one you're forced you take because your power fell off.

Still, it's a lot of change so we're going to keep it like it is on live (but we'll still need to reduce the damage on it because it deals really high base damage, especially when Lee is ahead). I still think it's important that there be a tradeoff between isolating a target or dealing maximum damage, but we'll think of that in the future.

Now that I've written so much... you can have the changes! I really hope you take the time to read through the above so you can understand the changes below. I also noticed some misunderstanding behind total attack damage versus bonus attack damage.  While it does seem like some values are much lower than their current live values, the scaling with total attack damage means Lee Sin will scale better into late game but will snowball less when he gets a bunch of AD items in the early game.

Okay they don't stream so you don't get to see their personalities as MUCH as you might see NA players' personality. However that doesn't mean their robots walking around, just playing games. I'd be pretty pissed as a player if I came out of a world's game against another region and all the comments are rather about ""personality"" rather than skill difference. Then again that's probably why I'm not a pro (among many many other reasons). 

EU actually has a lot of personalities and the players have amazing banter, especially via Twitter. I don't have a twitter account but even I browse through their from time to time cause EU players are quite often stirring shit up.

When they're on the analyst desk as well, or casting on the double bot lane stream (Krepo, Zven and Mithy put up an amazing cast) you CAN see their personalities quite clearly. 

I'm of course an EU fan so I'm naturally biased but I'm also a fan of League E-Sports in general. I am not saying NA, KR or EU are equal in terms of ""personality"". All I'm trying to say is this idea of ""EU players have no personality"", is a SUBJECTIVE opinion but an opinion that shows a lack of knowledge of the scene and it's players.

And for the love of God please don't turn the comment section into  EU > NA or NA > EU.

I'm here to play the raid, not listen to you making crude jokes.",26,3rafjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3rafjq/sexual_harassment_is_not_okay_im_here_to_play_the/,756,1446512726.0,"First off, let me say, I made a post a few weeks ago about how much I love the Destiny community because, as a girl, I have had little bad experiences. I had a few people add me off of Reddit and I have played with them more than once. They have all been wonderful. This is the first bad experience I have had in Destiny and I want to share this so that maybe I can help prevent anything of the sort from happening to my fellow female guardians.
My boyfriend and I ALWAYS play together. If I'm on and I'm in a fireteam, you can bet that my boyfriend will be there. So with that being said, my boyfriend and I were running strikes and we got invited by a random who had added me from patroling the Dreadnaught to do the raid. We thought sure, why not. So we joined and while the random who invited us didn't say too much, there were two guys in the group who would not stop making derogatory and crude statements towards me. I was the only girl in the lobby. You see, I can deal with immaturity, I can deal with blatantly gross sex statements and jokes. No big deal. What I can't deal with is you undermining me and acting like I can't play the game because I'm a girl or you making disgusting sex jokes and statements about me. That. Is. NOT. Okay. Now remember, my boyfriend was in the party and fireteam the whole time, he heard everything that was said to me. Such as when we were waiting for the kid to get to the chest by the pistons I was messing around and killing my teammates by pushing people off the ledge, this guy said ""I'm going to pull your pants down and spank you, nasty girl."" NOT OKAY. I let that slide because I really wanted to finish the raid. But as we continued on, the insults, statements, and ""jokes"" got worse and worse. My boyfriend was getting seriously pissed and I was extremely uncomfortable. We get to the sisters and my boyfriend sends me a text asking to leave because he was too mad and was afraid he would seriously insult this kid if he kept being crude to me. So we left.

Oh and let me say, I'm 306 light, I have the exotic sword, the NTTE, the Black Spindle, the ToM, and I have beaten the raid multiple times. I can hold my own just as well as a guy can. When I'm playing Destiny my gender does not define me. We are all guardians, regardless of gender.

Moral of the story, do not under any circumstances think that sexual harassment is okay. Those ""jokes"" that you might think are funny are very offensive and crude. And let me just remind you, women get sexually abused and raped every day. You never know what trauma they have faced and you never know if your words may trigger them. We female guardians came here to play the raid, just like you, and we do not want to listen to you being a chauvinist pig just because we are girls.

This is the first bad experience I have had and hopefully my last. I genuinely believe that as whole the Destiny community is better than this. We're a great community, let's keep it this way. This is simply a friendly reminder to watch what you say, just because you think it is funny does not make it okay. 

Keep fighting guardians, women and men alike! We're ALL guardians. 

Edit: Let me add, my boyfriend and I did tell them to stop. Multiple times. But they continued to do so and that's the reason we left when we got to the sisters.

Edit 2: While I'll agree that we should have left earlier, it was late at night and we just wanted to finish the raid without having to get a whole other group together. That's why we didn't leave earlier. Also, this didn't start until about halfway through the raid (Golgoroth). Oh and when I say the sisters I'm referring to Oryx's daughters, that's what we call them. 

Edit 3: As you can all see I received a fair amount of hate for this post which was honestly well expected. Let me make it clear that not once did I say that men aren't treated unfairly as well. As a matter of fact, during this same raid experience, the guys wouldn't stop yelling at my boyfriend and blaming him for stuff that they messed up on. They treated him awful as well. Yes I did make this post gender specific, I did that for a reason and if you can't see the reasoning behind it then I won't even bother explaining it to you. I am well aware that men get mistreated in the gaming community but the fact of the matter is that is often much more frequent and much worse when women are playing. 

With all that being said, I have actually had quite a few really nice people add me from this post. Some that added me last night actually helped us beat the sisters and Oryx before the reset. So despite all of the hate I've received, some good did come from this post. To all the positive comments and messages, and to the people who added me THANK YOU SO MUCH. You all are what keeps inspiring me to continue with gaming. To my female guardians, keep your chin up and keep fighting. To all my male guardians (the ones that aren't complete assholes), thank you for making women gamers feel more welcome in the gaming community.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-11-02 19:05:26

I stabbed my middle/high school bully during the last quarter of my senior year three times. AMA,527,27gv57,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27gv57/i_stabbed_my_middlehigh_school_bully_during_the/,3070,1402061877.0,"
Why? Every day imagine this feeling.

You arrive at school and head to the breakfast line to get some food. You are so nervous about the day already starting out terrible due to the Bully and his posse. But you're lucky today - no outbursts.

You get your food, and sit down with your best buddies. You start to take the first bite of your food, and before it even entering your mouth it's smacked out of your hands, and you're called a queer, faggot, retard, loser, waste. Every day it was different.

There was pain in gym class which i had to retake my senior year due to FEAR in my freshmen year of taking it.

I even was in this program called ""Shop"". It's where kids went to another facility on a bus to learn a trade. I had to use the same bus as him due to our last names being close. Alphabetical order (Even if i tried sneaking on the other bus i'd just get in trouble)

When the kid would get on, or off the bus i'd get physically slapped, punched or pushed along with tons of name calling that was just hurtful. I remember specifially these things they would make with soda bottles where they would let all the air out, twitch it up to an extreme amount, seal the bottle and launch the cap off VERY hard hitting me in the back of the head.

Now recap that from your 6th grade year up until your senior year, and yes I tried talking to councilers who had it written down that I'd receive some sort of help - but it seemed like nothing helped. I had told the crooked principle, dean and numerous teachers, and with the exception of a FEW teachers it just seemed like me saying anything just got myself into more trouble with them.

With what? A friends pocket knife

Did he live? Yes I stabbed him in the lower part of his neck, his shoulder, and his side.

My consequences? I was under house arrest a month, probation 6 months, 6 years of hell on earth and not being able to even attend my graduation.

Did he bully me again? Nope - never saw him again after that day.

It happened like this..

During 7th period (Our final period) he kept throwing paper at me and cutting his throat with his finger. I kept looking away from him and holding onto that knife in my pocket... We get up to leave, and I'm thinking to my self ""This shit is crazy, i'd never actually do something like that, haha""

Then all of a sudden he turns around, talks some shit and before I even have the chance to say anything he kicks me VERY hard in the nuts, and punches me so hard that my tooth actually goes through my lip. At that time I'm pushed backwards on my best friend into a door, he pushes me up and says ""Get him!""

I black out there, but after I come to I'm standing there with blood on the floor, lockers and knife screaming ""You will never bully anyone else again, you're done"" and I just kept saying ""You're threw with this shit!"" ""You're Done!"" over, and over.

There were 50 or so kids circled around us in the hallway after it was done.





The most horrible experience of all was missing out on 99% of social activities during my middle, and high school time. I didn't even get to walk the stage during graduation, or even ATTEND it for that matter. I was the bad guy.


edit 1 I Just want to say **thank you** to everyone giving me their support, and kind words. It truly means a lot to me. I hope anyone else going through the same things I went through can get SOME SORT of help. Better help then I received at least.






edit 2 WOW this blew up WAY bigger then I thought it would have! I am taking a small break (11:48AM EST) Right now, I'll answer some more questions in a little bit. 

edit 3 I'm back shortly - I'm answering as many questions as I can! 

edit 4 Okay I have things to take care of - I have to call it quits for today. If this is still up tomorrow i'd be happy to answer more questions, and feel free to privately message me if you're being bullied, and just need someone to talk to. Have a nice day.

Content Policy Update,4000,3fx2au,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/,18504,1438805878.0,"Today we are releasing an update to our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.

Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.

Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.

Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.

I believe these policies strike the right balance.

update: I know some of you are upset because we banned *anything* today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit. I'm off for now, thanks for your feedback. RIP my inbox.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-08-05 15:17:58

This is faulty logic because suicide is a much greater danger in our society and Dota 2's demographic than racism, sexism, and homophobia.  


>In 2013, 41,149 suicides were reported, making suicide the 10th leading cause of death for Americans


>Suicide is the SECOND leading cause of death for ages 10-24


>Suicide is the THIRD leading cause of death for college-age youth and ages 12-18


>More teenagers and young adults die from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease, COMBINED


>It is very common to play with someone suffering from depression and it is not okay to contribute to his mental illness or belittle mental health's significance.


Also, it is not okay for Sumail to say ""kill yourself"" because it is common in Pakistani culture.  Sumail isn't living in Pakistan, but in the United States of America.  If Sumail made racist, homophobic, or sexist remarks and tried to rationalize it by saying it was common in his culture, would you tolerate it?  Then why is it okay for him to get away with suicidal insults?

This is not a thread where I will be saying that I cheat and got banned. I never cheat even tho I have access to a paid cheat that has been undetected since the launch of CS:GO, it's also safe for FaceIT, ESEA and CEVO.

I got access to the injector and the cheat launcher, can I provide that to valve somehow and make them use it against the cheat providers or is just the cheat it self useless for them to have?

Why do I have access to a cheat but I am not cheating you may ask, this is because I helped an admin on the page with some issues he had (not cheat related) and there for got 1 month of free subscription.
I have tested and verified that the cheat works, I did so by using -insecure and load the cheats vs bots.

Just want to help the community out if possible in the battle vs cheaters. Any ideas if I can be helpful by using any of the things I have access to?

EDIT:
I do not have permissions to post in the VAC forum of valve. That is why I have not reported this cheat via their forum. So if any other way is possible I would like to know.

I can still sign in, launch the cheat and use it (have still not been used other then private server). As stated before it's HWID banned to my computer but I can unlock that ban before I send it to anyone of interest.

And no, I don't know that much about programming etc, the issue I helped them with has nothing to do with webpage/programming.

EDIT 2:
Tried to get as many of the files as possible while running the cheat and save them down (creates new ones each time you use it), also made a video of how the cheat installs/works, what it does to you computer when injected and also what ""drivers"" you need to install in order to run it. Hopefully all this will be to some sort of help for someone. I will just sit tight on it until I can post on the VAC forums or get in contact with someone important.

My guess is that a ban is incoming shortly on my account for the cheat. So I want to gather as much info as possible before getting myself banned. Valve wont answer me and I can't sit around for days just waiting for them so this was my try of doing something for the community. Hopefully it all works out.

No more updates will be posted since this lead to nothing except a lot of trash talking. 
Sorry that I upset so many people and there is lies being called all over the place. I tried.

But with this event tied to the cosmetic you are limiting access to a portion of the game behind a premium, this is a slippery slope that has the potential of turning into a cliff face with much more insidious things at the bottom.

"[DISCUSSION] ""Shut up and take [back] your money"" Star Citizen detox program",0,3atkqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/3atkqd/discussion_shut_up_and_take_back_your_money_star/,500,1435060990.0,"As everybody knows by now, there's a certain group of crybabies in Star Citizen communities who keep pissing me off with their never-ending wails to the tune of ""Whyyyyyyy [ Arena Commander | Star Marine | <insert their favorite ship here> | etc ] is not yet releeeeeeased??? I paid monies, gimme NAO!!!"". 

Needless to say, this small but excessively vocal group evokes the same feelings in me as a little shitter starting to cry aboard the airplane in the middle of a transatlantic flight might evoke in anyone.

I'm a software developer. I absolutely dearly remember my BEST contract job ever when, effectively, I was told, ""Here's your workstation. Here's the spec of what we need. Go for it."" There was no time limit, no pressure, no nothing: the guy who contracted me *knew* that software is ready when it's ready, and not any sooner. The result was the *best* product I ever produced.

This is exactly the reason why I donated nearly $29000 (yes that's *twenty-nine thousand*) to RSI: I *know* that Chris is aiming for the best quality a dev can dream of, and not for some shitty ""get-it-out-of-the-door-now"" crap: no, it will be ready *when it's ready*, and I will not accept anything less.

Now, that said, I despise the abovementioned crybabies not only because they piss off me personally, but also because they are stealing CIG's valuable time (paid for, in a not too insignificant part, by myself).

So, I propose a ""Shut up and take [back] your money"" detox program. Namely: the community will identify the most annoying ""Why X is not out yet"" complainer out there, and I will contact Customer Support to figure out how much (or rather, how little) that crybaby has donated to the game. THEN, I will *buy him out*: I will pay him back everything he put in (except for physical goods and subscriptions of course, because he already got back his value on those) on the condition that he will be *banned forever* from the game and the forums. 

What do you think?

Riot's bias against CLG is nonexistent,146,48dano,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/48dano/riots_bias_against_clg_is_nonexistent/,307,1456789184.0,"I really don't understand how the other thread got 1500+ up votes. Why/how would Riot benefit from being biased against CLG. Riot is not a person we aren't even talking about Riot we're talking about the production team who puts together teasers/videos for the LCS so I don't see how bias would affect what content they put together. Their end goal is just to make the most hype teasers they can and pursue the best story lines possible. The examples of ""Riot's bias"" given in the previous thread were so poor.

1. **Lunch with DL and Yellowstar:** Riot showing a video about TSM's new bot lane as the intro to the new season instead of something about CLG. Serious? Doublelift to TSM was the biggest roster move to happen in NALCS of all time. Yellowstar leaving FNC rivals it. The two players on the same roster is ridiculously hype. Focusing on that story line over talking about CLG (who were coming into the split with a different roster and not even the same team who won the previous split) is not an indication of bias.

2. **CLG vs C9 game:** Yes, the teaser for this game should have included more footage about CLG. With that said, trying to argue that CLG has some kind of story line going that even come close to rivaling what Riot can talk about C9 is insane.

3. **Cutting Aphro's Interview Off:** Unlike what OP claimed, we have seen interviews with the losing team before, and we have seen interviews with both losing and winning teams before. They are rare but that's common sense. Losing teams aren't usually up for interviews. Seeing both perspectives of the game is awesome I don't know why you'd be against it. Maybe they shouldn't have cut off Aphro's time or they could have made the transition smoother but that's on the production team. Claiming that this is a result of ""bias"" though is once again far-fetched at best.

Overall, we will most likely see CLG hyped up more and be more relevant in story lines. Stixxay's improvements and Darshan's split pushing are great places to talk about but just because other teams have greater story lines to talk about does not mean that Riot's production team has some kind of weird unprecedented bias against a team.

Edit: Some good discussion and counter points! I still tend to believe that at the worst Riot slightly favors other teams and their story lines but I don't think you classify that as ""bias"". Also, Please ignore my flair. I am not a IMT fanboy salty about CLG winning. I don't really openly support any team and just like watching good games. I tend to flair whichever team has players that I like on it. I love POB, WT, and Huni. I love Darshan and Aphro just as much.",controversial_subreddit,0,2016-02-29 17:39:44

So, I watched a lot of TI4 last year and even more TI5 this year, and I had a ton of fun watching it - but as an otherwise-exclusive LoL player (maybe like 5 Dota 2 bots games played), I enjoyed watching it a ton, and the hype and storylines, but I didn't really understand what was going on in each game that well.

So, last year, for LoL Worlds I wrote a guide for newbies to League of Legends who wanted to watch Worlds anyway, and now it's updated for 2015!

* [Champion Flashcards](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/New_To_League/Champion_Flashcards/Alphabetically) - this is probably the most useful thing, it's a flashcard for each champ that explains in a really TLDR way what they do, but also has a link to their full infopage

Todays games between 2 Korean teams have been ever worse. Slower pace with more/same amount of mistakes than OG-FW game.

CIG will go through your PMs if you criticise them,21,47fl39,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/47fl39/cig_will_go_through_your_pms_if_you_criticise_them/,852,1456353785.0,"Maybe a bunch of people will think I'm an asshole who deserves this, but I thought you guys should know something that I discovered today when I got banned from the CIG forums.  My story is as follows:

I've never posted on the CIG forums before, but on the 12th of Dec I read a heart breaking thread by a guy who had fallen on hard times and felt the game hadn't delivered.  He was refused a refund and was really down in the dumps about it.  I didn't want to cause drama but I sent him a PM telling him that EU consumer law and bank charge back policies may mean that he may be able to get his money back.  Maybe you hate me for suggesting this to him, but I honestly felt sorry for him.

2 and a half months go past and all is well.  I've still not made any posts on the forums, until yesterday when I made a few posts criticising CIG's marketing and one post about Sandi being thoughtless on the livestream with regard to Ben and some doughnuts.

A few hours later I am banned, the reason reads:

> Perma'd per report that user sent PM's encouraging backers to commit bank fraud.  Investigation confirms.

Now whether or not sending a PM about EU consumer law and bank refunds is ""bank fraud"" is an interesting question, but my first thought was ""what the hell, I sent that PM months ago and he only just reported me?""

So I check the guy's account.  He's not logged in since Jan 6th.  So I send the guy an email apologising if I have offended him and asking if he reported my PM.  He says he didn't report it and he's shocked that I am banned.  He says he received 10+ similar PMs and is worried that all of those people are now also banned.

Now, say what you will about whether or not what I said was ban worthy.  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

One thing is clear though.  If you criticise CIG on the forums forums in a way that is totally within the rules, they will go through your PMs to find any excuse to ban you.  No doubt about it.

Hopefully this information will help others avoid getting banned as I have been.  Apparently CIG will try to ban critics in any way they can.

Riot is Insisting that Teams Cover the Ticket Price Difference to Fly to Worlds from Korea,15,3l7brj,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3l7brj/riot_is_insisting_that_teams_cover_the_ticket/,496,1442428540.0,"A report recently released through the DailyDot states that Riot is refusing to pay for the tickets to fly teams currently bootcamping in Korean to Europe for worlds. Riot and the teams had stipulated that the plane tickets to worlds would be covered *but only from their place of residence*. The teams bootcamping in Korea right now would prefer that Riot fly them out directly as has been custom. Riot is insisting that Teams pay their way or at least pay the difference between the two ticket prices. E.g. CLG would have to pay the difference between an NA-EU ticket and KO-EU ticket, while Riot would cover the amount originally stipulated to.

I'm posting here for discussion of the topic, head over to DailyDot to see the original article.

**EDIT**: ~~The article isn't 404'd. The URL on the DailyDot that links to the article is incorrectly entered. It's missing ""-lol"". Hopefully they fix it because I cannot link the direct URL here.~~ The URL has been fixed. You can access it by visiting the DailyDot's ""Esports"" topic page. I cannot directly link it here.

~~**EDIT 2**: I'm in class but I'll explain a bit about what the ""issue"" is here since a lot of people seem to see it as a non-issue.~~

**EDIT 3**: Moved my explanation to a comment because people were finding it too biased. I added it because I received a large number of comments dismissing the issue as a non-issue. That opinion is fair and I don't blame anyone for having it. But I saw that happening because of the article's issue with its URL improperly linking on DailyDot's website. To explain why people *should* be paying attention, I explained how I saw the problems here. If that came off as too biased against Riot (putting my biases out there, I do think Riot should cover the costs), **I apologize**. The article now properly links, so you can just head over there to see it.

"I'm 10 years in IT, I witnessed how mobile market arise, Steam and indie. And I'm sure exclusives are THE BEST for VR consumers in near team. Want to pour a load of sh-- on me? Ok, but hear my points and try to think before",0,4o1qbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/4o1qbj/im_10_years_in_it_i_witnessed_how_mobile_market/,212,1465915639.0,"I run an IT company, I know how things in market are from business terms. VR is an emerging market, very fragile, and it could die in its infancy, even before it takes off

Game dev is not a charity, game devs need $ to break even at least, or better if you want a next bigger game from them. If you want to have great VR content it needs A LOT of investment. From business angels, private investors, funds and so on. If some of investors are successful others would come, if some of a bigger investors are unsuccessful it's toxic for all the market

Steam is a harsh PC games monopoly and in order to compete with them you need some leverages. For example, a closed platform ecosystem(remember, how Steam all started in 2003? It was all the same). Even with this practice it's really hard to complete with monopoly, only Riot or Blizzard come near to it(in a much smaller scope, though) 

It's hardware pushing up software sales and vice versa. Call it Apple way, game consoles way, or just something way -- but this practice is there for decades and there's nothing anti-consumer in it

Vive sales are already slowing down a bit from June 1st and there're no more than 65-70k of Vive owners to date. (Go to SteamSpy for the sources)

Let it be 100k of Vives to August 1st(still optimistic, but ok). Best selling Vive game(only one from MANY MANY others) could sell up to 50% of user base. Let it be a $20 game, because why not? And good guys Valve would take 30%+ of commision(it could be 40%, but let's assume 30%)

It means than THE BEST SELLING Vive game could give it's devs as much as $700k, not counting cost of making. Maybe more, maybe less, but the possible ROI(return of investment) ballpark is tiny, the market is still so small

It's just nothing in terms of sales or game investment; ZERO market. If not for Oculus and their exclusives we'd stay with crappy Steam Early Access indie and paid demos for YEARS. VR needs to go to mass market and it means HIGH quality content for average consumer. Polished, finished and long enough. It's what Oculus is aiming for

It makes a complete sense to pay devs for exclusives for both platforms, it's good for consumers, devs and good for VR. I'm 200% sure we'll see much more Steam or Vive exclusives in near future and it's great!

What we need right now, is not an ideal world fulled of open-source, charity and 'good games are selling themselves' bullshit, but A LOT of great VR content. 

It could be archived only with  tech companies pouring money for dev. And Oculus success(as a pioneer and highest profile VR company out there) is crucial for VR success. If Oculus fails in near term -- VR fails and fails hard to death

So, please, try to think outside a box and care about not you don't having some games on your devices, but for a greater VR good

When a market is established that would be the time for holy wars, boycotts and other fanboy stuff. We have other problems for this new infant industry that matter and they could be a child killers. And it's not the Oculus business practices",controversial_subreddit,0,2016-06-14 09:47:19

(I decided to gut and rebuild this whole section since the amount of hate I've been getting for just trying to analyse the data a bit was just getting ridiculous.)

Instead:

It would be really nice if we got some people from the EU Riot teams to cover things as well as the NA team does, it would really help to build the personality of the EU scene a bit more with something like ""Deficio's analysis of the playoff teams"" (with a better name obviously).

I'm not attacking either Riot NA or EU. Riot NA does a great job promoting their region and we can only speculate why it is that Riot EU produces this significant amount less so it would be unfair to target either region obviously.

All playlists can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/LoLChampSeries/playlists) so if you wish to tell me that I've omitted certain results to favour my conclusion please point out which unfavourable results I have omitted without explaining why I have done so.

>I've omitted 4 mic checks for NA (opposed to 0 for EU) on the basis that there might simply not have been games worth covering to that extent in EU (I don't remember if there were or not).

> I've omitted 28 NA spotlight videos compared to 21 EU spotlight videos as the counterpart. I didn't include these on the basis that both regions were equally represented in terms of having playlists that spotlight players and general things like that.

> I didn't include the ""Phreak on the street"" playlist but I feel like I should have done - I only didn't on the basis that it wasn't to do with players or pro teams but now looking at it, it is just more content from NA. So that's 3 more for NA which I omitted.

I won't draw any radical conclusions from it basically.",controversial_subreddit,0,2016-05-02 06:40:59

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HdnEJbrW8g



Text: 

I made a video explaining absolutely everything.

Still, I'll write everything down for those who don't wanna watch the video.

First of all, I wanna point out that I dislike answering drama, but this got to a point where it surpassed the 'drama' word.
Now it's not drama anymore, It's him making people believe I'm something that I'm not.

Anything. Listen, anything you've readed about me coming out of this guy's fingers is either 1. Taken out of context. or 2. A filthy lie.

The TL'DR of this is: ""I'm happy. 
I never owed money; I don't owe money, and I will NEVER owe money to anyone. I'm consecuent and a man of his word.
I love every human being. I have no proves of this whatsoever. Only the words of those who share life with me or ever met me. In no case my idea was to make harm or show hate. I repeat it, I Love every single human being, does not matter what the conditions are.
This means that my love for Homosexual humans is infinite. Does not matter what.
Same goes for my love for humans with mental illness. I love them, I treat them as good as I know, and I help them everytime the chance appears.
Saying anything different than this IS a lie.


I also understand ls's PoV and his actions, and I can understand the reason he wants this much spotlight. 
With a lease to pay and jobless, a move is needed to comeback on track. Before he was jobless, now he's in the spotlight and with possibly a couple of job offers.
Survival instinct. Kill or die.

Now I actually look back and remember that story about Tom Cruise, that other story about Benzema and his family, the other one about Ronaldo Nazario... And many more of (always) succesful people, and say: ""yeah, that was probably false.""
""Our TV"" is Reddit. Reddit decides who is right or wrong for the eyes of the public, no matter if it's true or false.

In fact, I'm planning to make a streaming session on Sunday 9th November with this earning details:
- 40% of the income will go to http://iglhrc.org/ (International Gay & Lesbian human rights commission).
- 40% of the income will go to http://www.nami.org/ (National Alliance on Mental Illness).
- Additionally, 20% of the income will go to lastshadow's flat Lease Rent.

To finish this TL'DR, think carefully:
- Why would I risk the perception people has about me, my fame or my name for a couple of hundred dollars?
Not to put more wood in the fire but, luckily for me, I have no problems whatsoever keeping up with much higher payments than that one daily.

I am happy. My family is happy. My teammates and workers are happy. My old workers will never come out and say I didn't pay them or treated them wrong.
I wake up happy, I go to bed happy.
Working for my dreams, without having to creep like a snake for a couple of pennys. Leaving no corpses behind me, but happiness and joy. Blizzard, SK Gaming, Riot Games, Turtle Entertainment (ESL), any of my older teammates, or anyone I've met Anywhere in my life, can confirm.


I'm also hot blooded, and an angry motherfucker when these things happen (especially when I have nothing to do with it), but it literally lasts 5 minutes. Yes, those are very stupid rough and nonsense 5 minutes. But then I go to my little meditation corner, and drive myself away from those negative thoughs.
Yes, I threatened him with ""denying his entrance anywhere near eSports"" which was a very stupid thing to say. But in no situation I would actually do that after those 5 minutes of hot spanish blood tension. 
In no way I will EVER harm anybody on purpose. Especially when the situation colds out. I'm not that person.
This, and 'overtrusting' people were my biggest mistakes in this situation.

I got suggested by my lawyers to sue this guy. Everything would actually look good to win it myself, but honestly, it's not in my plans to make this guy's life more miserable than how it is right now.
All I want is him to come out and say the truth, and stop the bleeding. Not even that, I just want him to stop stabbing to stop the bleed.


I'd also like to apologize to all those who missunderstood the whole situation and though I meant any harm towards any specific group. 
It was not my intention. At all. And actually this message is directed mostly to you.""



Said this, I'd like those who crossed a word with me, worked with me, or simply shared their lifes with me at any point of their lifes, to come to this reddit thread and be honest about how I behaved or treated them.

I feel grateful towards the opportunity eSports and its community gave me to become something greater than just a man with a life.
Now I can make a change in the world, making other's lifes better.



Thank you :)

The scene has been gradually developing towards an insufferable environment for anyone not d'accord for what basically passes as white supremacy at best, fascism at worst. You quite literally have people in that thread claiming antisemitism is not racism because Jews are not a race and dropping N-bombs ain't that big a deal because dem blacks do it all the time. The amount of ignorance and miseducation is mind-boggling, there is no other way to put it. Being subject to racial abuse (whether casual racism or blatant racism) is horrific and at this point, not even memers like Gorman find it particularly funny. Humour doesn't excuse racist remarks. Rather, it appears to have turned into a poor pretense to just spout any racist garbage while avoiding confrontations since your statement was for the LULS to begin with.



EDIT: Thanks for all the contributions. I think this thread served its function of raising some awareness for the matter pretty effectively. The amount of hateful comments I received (hateful private messages too) and still receive should give some insight into how low the moral standards of some people in this sub are. 
Generally, belittling racism with the most absurd explanations that defy any logic, rationale and historical context like ""words are just sounds, they mean nothing unless you lend them power"" are an insult to everyone's intelligence and should just be avoided. Also, I find the dichotomy of people accusing ""SJW""s of being overly sensitive while being responsible for 80% of the outrage themselves in this thread rather interesting. So far, very few if any compelling reasons have been stated as to why the sanctity of racial abuse in the light of ""jokes"" is more important than treating minorities or any ethnic groups with respect, but yeah. I certainly fail to see how the bigots on here are the true victims but I'm open to all suggestions.",controversial_subreddit,0,2016-11-15 11:05:31

> “Elo-boosting” is the **repetitive and intentional act of an individual playing on someone else’s account (a “client”) for the purpose of artificially improving the client’s Elo rating.** There is no minimum number of games required to be played, nor a minimum amount of Elo gain necessary to qualify as Elo-boosting. An attempt to boost Elo need not be successful in order to qualify as a rule violation. 

The accounts CLG shared were Platinum. When discovered, Aphro's account specifically was Platinum 5. Is there a reason you chose to consider it account sharing and not elo-boosting?

Was it to not punish CLG in LCS play?

> There is no way to know whether an Elo-booster performed a boost for money or other consideration, but all boosts are viewed as wrong.

Looks like the boosted the elo of their accounts to play against high level Koreans, right? That's pretty much their consideration. 

Under your definition of elo-boosting, this applies. Here's your definition of account sharing which doesn't seem to apply here:

> The following does not constitute Elo-boosting:
•Permanently transferring a high-Elo account to a less-skilled player. This is illegal, but it’s in the nature of account-sharing and/or account-selling, not account-boosting.

**Edit: Thank you for the gold, kind person who appreciates a different perspective.**

**Edit 2: I believe CLG boosted accounts without the intent to boost them for a client. I believe they boosted those accounts with the intent to play in high Korean elo. 

Ask yourselves. What would have happened to those accounts when CLG returned home? Do those accounts get returned to the user with a  much higher MMR?**",controversial_subreddit,0,2014-08-12 09:35:51

**Fist of all:** the mysterious ""missing component"". This vague statement refers to Xbox One Controller + Wireless Adapter.
While it might sound ridiculous that such ubiquitous accessory could be in short supply, it is important to understand that this device is manufactured in a very precise batches based on the demand simulations. Such predictions are relatively easy to make, as demand for Xbox One console + additional controllers sold via retail is pretty much constant and it does not fluctuate a lot outside of holiday season. Having strict production volume control in place allows to avoid expensive 'overstocking' (warehouse fees and overhead) and enables having streamlined, optimal and efficient manufacturing line (which brings further cost advantage). Additionally, Wireless Adapter is produced in much lower volume, as it targets relatively small market of PC gamers, mostly enthusiasts.


**Second thing:** all Rift components (HMD itself, camera, controller, boxes and so on) are delivered directly to one of the local distribution centers (US, EU, AUS/ASIA and so on) where final QA, packaging and shipping to the customers is done. They all come from different sources and locations, but till recently everything has been going well.


**Thirdly:** To give you some idea of the volume we are talking about here, day-one preorders are in the ballpark (huh) of 300K units - these are to be shipped ASAP (the actual backlog is larger). This figure is almost quarterly production volume for Xbox Controller Wireless Adapter (I think you can see now where all of this is heading...).

We were promised about 100K Controller + Adapter units delivered by Microsoft directly to the distribution centres at the end of Feb + regular monthly batches thereafter and were advised multiple times that everything is on track. When shipment date was getting close, shocking truth was revealed: due to ""omission"" by Microsoft stocking department, ""our"" batch of controllers was actually never allocated and reserved - there was simply nothing to ship! This was absolutely shocking case of mismanagement.

Then the hell broke loose. Countless conference calls later it was clear that there is no chance for MS to deliver any substantial volume of units at least until the end of the March. This was definitively the most stressful period in my career ever, it was already March, we had no controllers to put in the boxes and the atmosphere was very tense. At this point literally every single possible solution was evaluated. Microsoft was able to provide a few thousands units on a very short notice, but this was not nearly enough. Additionally, all sort of wholesale (and even retail) vendors were approached, with some success - so that is why small batches of the Rifts (mostly for Kickstarter backers) were actually sent out.

There was discussion if Xbox controllers should just be replaced with ""vouchers"" in the box entitling customers to claim Xbox controller later, either in one of the retail outlets or via Oculus Store, but this idea was eventually dismissed as: a) it would be too complicated logistically, especially on such short notice b) it would immediately reveal that MS is to blame for the situation, which they absolutely wanted to avoid c) most agreed that news headlines like ""Oculus shipping slower than expected"" sound better than ""Oculus (or worse: Facebook) is shipping incomplete product"" (while this might sound silly, it is very important for publicly traded company).

The main reason why no announcement was made earlier is because it was not clear how many controllers can be retrieved from alternative sources until very recently and assumption was made that Microsoft is going to deliver by the end of March. Manufacturing and shipping issues during product development are not uncommon (you get used to them in this business) and there was a good hope that the whole fiasco could be avoided. Additionally, it turned out that big Chinese retailer has a decent stash of controllers and dongles at their disposal, which sounded like a good backup plan. With all of this in mind, '1-3 weeks' emails were sent out, so it would allow us to buy some time when hopefully everything gets happily resolved in the background. However, this hope did not materialize: it turned out it would not be possible to get controllers from China on time (all sort of issues: customs, paperwork, company being 'difficult' to work with) and delivery from Microsoft slipped (again...). Of course in hindsight this was not the best way to handle things, but at that point it really looked like it would be possible to get away with minimum (if any) delay.

Eventually, when the alternative options failed, at the end of March the decision was made that:

- we keep trying to fetch as many controllers as possible from alternative sources to keep the orders flowing (albeit at excruciatingly slow pace)

- customers will be refunded shipping fees - this gets partially covered by Microsoft, as they agreed to provide substantial discount on (already discounted) controllers due to their mismanagement

- further update will be made on 04/12, after big batch of Rifts + controllers from early April delivery is QA'd, packed and ready to be shipped to the customers (the idea was to start dispatching large batches from 04/12, but it did not go that well...)

Current situation is as follows:

- the overdue, early-April batch of controllers took longer than expected to arrive, but they are here now - about 80K of them were received in distribution centers at the end of last week, with another similar batch coming later this or early next month. After all required processing is done, this will allow us to start shipping orders at full speed starting from the next week (hopefully earlier than later).

- shipping dates you were given today are quite conservative. Unless something goes catastrophically wrong (huh...), your Rift should be dispatched on the first day of the period stated in the email (it **could** be even sooner, but no promises!)  - code on the website simply adds 10 days to the initial date to generate the range in order to allow for some flexibility in case of unexpected problems (we have learned our lesson).

**The most important matter:** Despite all this mess, I want to emphasizes there was never any ill will or conspiracy here. I have got privilege to work with brilliant and extremely talented people who dedicated years of their hard work, with many sleepless night and weekends to make Rift happen. The hope that everything is going to be OK after ""component"" problem was identified was very real and tangible. I think pretty much everyone involved in the project is totally devastated by the current situation (believe, much more than you - even if you think this is not possible). It is unbelievably painful to see the entire precisely engineered product release plan to fall out by one detail that is not even under your control. Despite what you might think, there is a lot of people in the Oculus team who read this sub and they often take opinions here very personally - they dedicated a big part of their life to Rift after all. I can guarantee you that your concerns are being heard and I can only kindly ask you not to judge us and the Rift based on this incident.

I totally agree that communication aspect here could have been handled much better. I am sure if we knew what we know now, completely different decisions would had been made (yes, I know, easy to say now). And now: believe me, the team would love to officially announce what exactly is going on, but contractual agreement absolutely prevent us from disclosing any details about the deal with Microsoft publicly - and this includes nature (or even existence) of any problems, if/when they arise. Despite that, I (and I am sure many others) still feel that we failed the community who put a lot of trust in our words - this is why I am writing this now, although it might not be the most sensible thing to do. Please forgive us. We all learned a lot from this situation and strive to do much better in the future.

Ah, and the last thing: want some ""proof""? Look at the serial numbers of XBox controllers shipped with Rifts so far. While normally range of these numbers should be relatively uniform, as they would be coming from one big preallocated ""chunk"", in fact the number can differ a lot as many of controllers are from the completely different batches - this is an echo of frantic search by Oculus Team for every available Xbox One controller in existence.",controversial_subreddit,0,2016-04-12 15:57:44

I have been 3 years following esports and I have never seen so much toxicity in the community.

It is no longer a friendly and funny joke when literally some people from both regions are looking for the most offensive things that they can say. And even worse, there are people that actually believe what they are posting.

I am completely sure that if this amount of offensive comments existed 3 years ago I wouldn't be an esport fan

The official twitch channel of Riot Games has the worst community of the website. What kind of marketing is that?

Don't you dare to tell me that you can't mod 100k viewers because I have seen channels with 100k viewers be moded. Please be mature and add ban words.

Don't tell me to ignore it because this is getting bigger and bigger and is starting to overcome other communities too.

I am sure that we are close to start seeing comments about wishing other people to kill themselves just for being from other region.

Riot talks about sportsmanship and fights against toxicity. Meanwhile, they have allowed a joke evolve to an offensive and toxic fight.

**Edit**: I would like to clarify that I am European and a huge EU fan. A lot of people in comments assume that i am North American for some reason.

**I don't care if the harsh comment goes towards EU or NA. And it doesn't matter if you are from EU or NA**

I have to admit that I laugh a lot reading twitch chat, I have even laughed a lot reading this thread. However, there were a lot of people that seem offended and takes it seriously, creating a bad environment and ruining the fun. Usually this creates out of context comments that snowball in even more hateful speech.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-12-13 01:46:17

How to be a non reportable toxic player in league of legends.,40,2dsbxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2dsbxm/how_to_be_a_non_reportable_toxic_player_in_league/,247,1408263030.0,"This is guide on how to be a non reportable toxic player in league of legends.

**Champion Select**

* If you are first pick, ban champions that counter your lane or champions you just don't like. Last game did the enemy do really well with [insert champion here]? Ban them. Your team mates might tell you to ban champions like Rengar, jax or Braum but don't worry the enemy will do that for you. 

* Since you're first pick anyways, haven't you always wanted to try out marksman? Seems like the perfect time to test out Twitch, oh even better didn't Gnar just come out? Try him instead.

* Don't bother call a role in champion select, your team should already know where you're going based on your champion. Like Vayne Top, wait until everyone is locked in say ""btw I'm going top"" Your team might get upset but hey it's pick order!  so they'll understand and most likely dodge.

**Entering the rift**

* Wait about 1:30 before actually buying items and walking to lane, this will ensure you won't have to leash your jungler or worry about getting killed if the enemy invades. 

* Level 1 fights. Always try them, you'll win always. Just because you don't have ignite doesn't mean you won't out damage that Darius.

* Pings are your friends, they let your jungler know when you need help. Spam ping as much as you can, like really spam until they gank your lane. If you don't gank then take it upon yourself to 1 v 1 the enemy again.

**/Mute all**

* It's your best friend, when your team starts flaming you for going 0/9/1 by 15 mins but don't worry you still have late game. 

**Play the Victim**  

* One phrase will get you off the hook ""I'm having a bad game"" Those are the magical words that will make the people of the tribunal press pardon every time. 

* Use the word ""Toxic"" every second, you didn't follow up on the gank cause you didn't feel like it causing your jungler to die and he starts flaming you? Just say ""This lee so toxic omg, I'm sorry"" Your team will take your side no matter what.

* Also give your team encouraging words so when you feed it's okay, along the lines of ""we have late game"" or ""Don't worry we got this never surrender"" while being 0/10/2

**Never Group**

* Split pushing wins games, you've seen on youtube that trynd single handedly ending the game out pushing 5 other people. Well that's gonna be you! 

* You're the tank, you always die every team fight. Grouping isn't necessary any more, just keep on spilt pushing. Just spam ping your team to fall back as you remain top. 

**Copy Random Builds**

* Remember that Korean ad malp build? try it out. It works. You'll win lane. Always.

* Did you know when you buy a nashtooth on Prime Time Draven he says a cool quote? Try it out in ranked. Do it.

**Jungle**

* Always do one man invades and attempt to counter jungle before clearing your own camps first. If you die just say to mid ""dude, map awareness"" He'll start to flame you but just mute him and never gank ever again. Now you're building your flare. 

* Don't bother start a jungler item, they're stupid and pointless. Go Dorans or sword pots. 

* When your team mates back, push their lane but never hit the enemy turret. 

**Supporting**

* Screw the Gold income item, it's useless late game.

* Your adc sucks at csing, you should take so you can be tanky for team fights.

* Take every kill and type ""oops"" after

* Wards? You can ward the tri bush THAT ALL. Never ward any where else ever.

* Go damage, your team needs it. Ap Thresh here we go!

**Marksman**

* All marksman are the same, pick anyone. 

* Front line in every team fight

* Never follow up with the jungler, he never pinged so you don't have to do shit

* Don't bother freeze the lane, you need the cs you can get. Even if you have wards or not just keep pushing hard. Sometimes you'll miss most of it but that's alright. Late game will come.

* Start triforce on every marksman, even cait.

**Fighter/Tank**

* Call tank in champion select then go damage, your team will understand that you need to carry.

* Initiate at every chance you get, no matter how low you are or your team is. Even if it's a 2v4, go in it's your job!

* Focus their tank, why do you think you're building armor pen for?

* Play Riven or Yasuo for the first time. 

* You don't need wards, most top laners have escapes. 

* If they tell you to build tank, its because they don't want to carry.

* Fuck team fights, push lanes. 

* Fuck lanes, jump in team fights. 

**Mage**

* You need to push your lane!! You have no time for wards!!!

* Burst down their tank, he's after your marksman!

* You don't need boots until about 25 mins in game

* Don't bother roaming. 

* Don't bother push either.

* Take your jungler camps, he won't need them.

* Start double dorans, Chalice, Tear and Valor. So you'll never run out of mana.

* When you see your jungler being invaded, head for top. Then say sorry.

So I hope you guys enjoyed my guide, and GLHF",controversial_subreddit,0,2014-08-17 03:10:30
Stop posting American carrier bullshit,1311,1um5uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1um5uh/stop_posting_american_carrier_bullshit/,1199,1389089239.0,"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ujxfc/us_tmobile_will_buy_over_3_billion_in_700mhz/) thread is number 1 on /r/android right now but has nothing to do with Android. It doesn't mention any Android device, in fact the word 'Android' is nowhere to be found.

Carrier-specific posts are bad enough, and I also think those should be removed. Or the millions Motorola threads which don't apply to anyone outside of America. But this is a carrier and country specific post that *doesn't even have anything to do with Android*. Yeah you can use an Android on T-mobile - you can use an iPhone or a Windows Phone or a fucking Nokia 3310 as well. There's nothing Android specific here.

It's just American carrier rubbish again. Almost *nothing* except blogspam is allowed on this subreddit as it is, but *this* is permitted? Give me a break.

It has nothing to do with Android and only serves to reinforce the Android community and Google's attitude of 'America is the only country'. It's like if I own an Android I HAVE to be American and there's no other possibility. You don't find this shit in the other phone subreddits and you shouldn't find it here.

"Unpopular opinion: If you're running solo, and you get killed by a group of 4 rogues... it's your own fault.",87,4i5m96,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/4i5m96/unpopular_opinion_if_youre_running_solo_and_you/,661,1462548908.0,"Very tired of seeing solo players complain about what is the central idea of the DZ. I run solo 50% of the time and have very little issue with bumping into rogues. My secret; stay the hell away from people. 

There are other bosses that spawn regularly outside of the landmarks - learn where those are so that if other groups are cleaning up landmarks you don't get jumped by them. Extract somewhere that hasn't seen a lot of action lately. Study your map so that when rogue icons pop up you know how close/far away they are or what extractions zone they are camping. 

Running solo is actually pretty easy, it just requires a little more awareness. Occasionally you will get jumped and occasionally you will lose. However, it's that tension that SHOULD make the game fun - and as long as you play smart it won't happen often. 

Also - just because you kill 2 rogues who failed to ambush you doesn't mean you're a community hero. Rogues help make the game fun, stop acting like this is r/justiceporn. 

Lastly, if you REALLY can't handle it solo... use matchmaking or find another solo player and shoot them an invite, or convince a friend to play with you. 


.

**EDIT:** 
An argument I hear often: ""If you're a group of 4, you shouldn't be picking on solo players. Man-up and take on another group.""

Counter argument: If you're a rogue and see a solo player that just killed a boss an opened a chest and your farming for matts, or hoping for a lucky drop - these people are EXACTLY the targets you want to see. It's not about a ""fair fight"" it's about getting the best stuff. Not to mention the server will be chasing you down soon enough.

**EDIT 2:** I'm slowly watching the points on this post drop (already) which I expected. But to those downvoting I have to simply ask - what do you expect in the DZ?

**EDIT 3:** u/Freaking_poulet has some pretty good tips for people learning to run solo [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/4i5dvk/a_guide_for_new_lvl30_solo_dz_players/)

There are a few obviously salty people who it looks like are downvoting basically anything I post and anyone with a similar opinion while not contributing, ~~but aside from that I'm actually really happy to see that even opposing viewpoints have kept it moderately civil~~ (nope, not anymore. People are straight up attacking each other and calling each other ""retarded"" now. This is the toxicity of this sub in it's finest). I agree that PVE players need some additional love to this game outside of the DZ - but I think the DZ should reward players with a higher drop rate or slightly better loot since there is a higher risk.

"Every aspect of WoW is currently broken, from leveling, to raiding, and even PvP.",46,2jafrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2jafrg/every_aspect_of_wow_is_currently_broken_from/,764,1413347702.0,"**I know it sounds absurd, but seriously read this full post.** I have no idea how they could mess it up this badly. I have played this game from Vanilla till Mists of Pandaria. 5.4 MoP in my opinion has been the best gaming experience out of any in the warcraft timeline or any games timeline. Yes, even better than Vanilla or BC.

Unfortunately now, everything is broken and it doesn't look like there will be a fix coming any time soon because the flaws are incredibly deep. Let's list all of the problems:

Leveling - Questing

* Leveling up a new character right now is one of the worst experiences. Killing mobs takes twice as long, and as such, the entire leveling process has just been effectively doubled. Remember when you could triple pull enemies at your level to get more kills and items to complete your quests? Now you are back to killing one mob at a time at insanely slow speeds. Also, if you are a class without a heal, avoid taking damage at all costs. Tons of mobs can quickly kill you.

* Many mobs have abilities that are unsquished. For example, the bunny guys in the Valley of the Four Winds can one shot even an item level 580 tank. Their bite DoT is unsquished. There are literally hundreds of mobs like this.

Leveling - Dungeons

* Previously we could fly through every 5 man dungeon, quickly get loot and experience for leveling up. Now, even with a group geared to the teeth with full heirlooms can't beat a 5 man without insane luck. Almost every single dungeon enemy can 2 shot the tank - and this isn't just unsquished random abilities. Our stats are effectively many times lower than the corresponding dungeon tuning.

Raiding - Outdoor

* Ordos and the Celestial Bosses are now a huge pain in the ass. Remember that fire underneath Ordos that everyone sat in while facerolling him because we had the gear and the healers to back us up? Well now that fire is not squished properly and kills you in 5 ticks. It literally does 30K damage a tick. Good luck. Yu'lon's green goo also with kill you in a couple seconds too. I have no idea how Blizzard could have missed this.

* In general, these bosses die twice as fast as before, but the players die four times as fast. Huge heals need to be preemptive and spammed because the tuning a totally different ballgame now.

Raiding - Indoor

* ToES is now uncompletable because the last two bosses have unsquished mechanics. They will one shot you endlessly even on the easiest of difficulties.

* Heart of Fear has many amber shapers which require you to free a raid member by attacking them. It's too bad the amber shell is unsquished and has 6 million health. Hint: you won't be able to break it.

* ToT has some adds before Durumu that will one shot the entire raid again, even on LFR difficulty.

* SoO has many tuning issues in people getting one shot by nearly every boss since everything dies so fast and heals so fast. Burst damage and healing is really bad for this game. Also the Iron Stars in garrosh's room deal 350K+ damage on any difficulty. Yeah. 350,000 damage while we have around 100K health.

PvP - Arenas

* Arenas are a burst fest since there is no resilience and we all kill each other in two hits. A rouge ambushed me for 50K. I have 75K health. He then silences me with a kick, doesn't need to stun me, and hits again for 25K, you die. It isn't just rogue's that can kill people fast - It's everyone. Also, even mediocre healing spells heal you to full. The game is now about silences. I can get out of a CC or stun by using my trinket. Most healers can even use a move while stunned, like monk's Life Cocoon. But a 4 second silence is all you need to murder someone, since they can't get out of it and you kill people in two hits.

PvP - Battlegrounds

* Well the server is currently offline, but when it was working it was just as bad as Arenas. I hope you are a ranged class, because the melee melt instantly! Also, Alterac Valley has level 98 elite mobs instead of the ones meant for our level. Balinda can one shot the entire Horde army in one spell! How fun!

Pre-Expansion Questline

* I'm used to pre-expansion quest lines being kinda lame, but this one takes the cake. The UBRS server is like russian roulette. It kicks out people completely randomly with no questions asked and the new questline takes about 5 minutes to complete. The only cool thing you can do is get into UBRS, pray that you don't get kicked, and start killing some of the level 101 ogre's inside. They drop really high item level greens (580+), and a cooking book!

TLDR - Go read whatever part of the game you are interested in above to learn how it is completely broken.

The heart of the problem is the number squish. They have done it in such a way that everyone's health is a pinball machine that bounces between near death and full. Every hit you take reduces you to half hp. Every heal you take brings you to full. Healers notice this the most because they have to constantly try to predict damage and spam huge heals constantly. The tank's hp is literally all over the place. Duels often last less than 5 seconds. A 2v2 double DPS team can kill ANY healer in a single 4 second silence break in healing. They really do die that fast. 3v3 and up is only worse. Undoing the number squish is the first step in restoring sanity, but I believe Blizzard isn't going to make this change. They need the numbers to be smaller for the server computations and this may ultimately destroy WoW, save for some insane detailed number tweaking...

Athene Should Think Before He Speaks - Comments from a Pro,272,32gmt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/32gmt3/athene_should_think_before_he_speaks_comments/,709,1428945367.0,"Hey Guys,

Dart here again with a random post about someone that I have actually enjoyed watching since well back in his WoW paladin days. Now I will admit, I think Athene is hilarious. He is extremely charitable and is great at what he does. I don't think I have ever personally disagreed with his actions, up until he posted this video that made front page of reddit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GilVjOEk8Fc

In this video, Athene says that it is easy to play ""perfect"" in Hearthstone and that it requires little-to-no skill. He diminishes everything that many of the pro's have accomplished in this game. I have been playing this game for over a year now, at what I consider close to the top level, and still find myself making mistakes. He bases his assumptions off of the fact that he got to legend??? I apologize to those who are unable to get to legend themselves, but doing so does not require even a fraction of the top level skill required to excel in this game. 

I am currently watching Athene drop to the absolute pits of legend, ranks 500+ as he fails to win with even the easiest of decks to play, face hunter. He makes many mistakes and does not even seem to realize that they were mistakes at all. 

Now I know more posts about him only boosts his ego and viewership, but I am okay with that. He is a good guy who does a lot for the esports community and donates a lot of money towards children in need. 

So what is the point of this post? Athene, if you read this, I want to challenge you to a match (Bo5 or more) to prove the immense difference in caliber between a player like you and someone like me (and many others who deserve recognition for their skill level). If I win, I want a open apology towards the Hearthstone community saying that you pale in comparison to the majority of players in the game. I do not care if you stream the match or not, but I want you to realize that the competitive atmosphere of this game is not a joke.

Message me on twitter if you are not afraid of getting shown up by a no-name medical student who barely has time to play anymore:

News from Palestine and Israel for July 14th / 15th,23,2aqd5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aqd5x/news_from_palestine_and_israel_for_july_14th_15th/,1531,1405395334.0,"This topical news sticky is **part 2** of an experiment** /r/worldnews is going to run today. 

Yesterday we ran an experiment of using a sticky in contest mode.  The feedback within that thread was pretty evenly divided between people who liked it, and people who didn't. The feedback we've gotten via modmail was majority positive.

There are two significant complaints that shared by people on both sides. You did not like contest mode, because you want to be able to sort by new and you felt there was not as much discussion. 

So now we are going for a another trial period of one day to see if a regular thread listed as a sticky is a workable approach.

For those who missed the previous sticky, here are some issues we've been experiencing that led to this decision:

1. We've recently been overwhelmed with submissions about Palestine and Israel. Hence, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep /r/worldnews a place for news from around the world. Our subscribers have made it clear they are annoyed by how one topic dominates the sub, especially in the new queue.

2. Users have also been complaining en masse that some content related to this topic may have been attacked by downvote brigades and effectively been silenced this way.  Moderators have no tools to determine if this is actually the case or not but at our request the reddit administrators have investigated and told us they see no evidence of vote manipulation.  This has not alleviated many users' concerns.

3. Due to the sheer number of submissions, discussions of the current events are being spread out across several threads with the same arguments playing out across all of them.



### **Special rules apply for top-level comments in this sticky today:**

- **All top-level comments must consist of an article link only.** Be sure to use reddit formatting to turn text into a link to your article - do not just post the URL link.  Those will be removed.

- The articles should be relevant to the topic and follow the regular submission rules.  Articles should be news, not opinion or analysis and should be current.

- Memes or just images will be removed as usual.

- The link title may be customized, but should describe/quote the article and may not exceed 300 characters.

- If you edit your top level comment after any votes or replies, it will be subject to removal.

- If you encounter duplicate submissions, please send us both permalinks in the body of a [mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fworldnews).  We will then remove the duplicate.

 
If you submit a story about Israel or Palestine as a regular submission like you used to, it will automatically be removed, a flair ""use sticky"" will be attached and you'll be redirected to this thread in a comment reply.
 
**All current [/r/worldnews comment rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/wiki/rules) will still apply here.**

And now everyone is so disgusted by all the hate TSM got. If you play bad you get flamed bad, just deal with it. Other teams at least didn't pretend to be hot sh1t. All was hyped by fans, nor Froggen nor any other ALL player said that they will crush everyone (reddit created hype themselves and when it didn't happen - blame others), but what they got was even worse than what TSM is getting.

And no, no one who have at least some knowledge of the scene predicted TSM to go top 2. They said they can do it, but honestly, I haven't seen anyone to prefer TSM over SKT or EDG, just wishful and pitiful NA personas (hoping that trashing NA means something in context of international strenght). TSM had best chance ever to finish top 2, but it still was far-fetched.

And at last. I wish for trashtalking segments. Good trashtalking, not TSM-like. In LCK everything is prepared for the hype and text is witty, funny. TSM just bash.

Everyone has been asking me what I thought about famous controversial artist Richard Prince taking a series of SuicideGirls instagram posts and printing them out and selling them at a recent gallery show at the gagosian gallery of beverly hills for $90,000 a piece.

My first thought was I don’t know anyone who can spend $90,000 on anything other than a house. Maybe I know a few people who can spend it on a car. As to the copyright issue? If I had a nickel for every time someone used our images without our permission in a commercial endeavour I’d be able to spend $90,000 on art. I was once really annoyed by Forever 21 selling shirts with our slightly altered images on them, but an Artist? 

Richard Prince is an artist and he found the images we and our girls publish on instagram as representative of something worth commenting on, part of the zeitgeist, I guess? Thanks Richard!

Do we have Mr. Prince’s permission to sell these prints? We have the same permission from him that he had from us. ;)

I’m just bummed that his art is out of reach for people like me and the people portrayed in the art he is selling.

So we at SuicideGirls are going to sell the exact same prints people payed $90,000 for $90 each.

I hope you love them. Beautiful Art, 99.9% off the original price. ;)

HERE IS MY REPLY TO THE QUESTIONS I DIDN'T GET TO :)

I am really sorry I was not trying to dodge any questions, I DID actually reply to the top question initially my reply is just buried.  :)   I answered questions for 7 hours and the ones that were at the top during that time were about the Richard Prince issue I set up my IAMA about.  These comments and upvotes came up after I had signed off so I missed them but can answer them now in more detail.  

About 10 years ago a handful of the thousands of models on my site felt slighted and went to a competitor site.  We were sad to see them go, they were friends, it sucked, it felt personal and it hurt and it was lame.  We handled things the way that we felt at the time was best, but would we do the same things now, probably not.  We learned from the experience and in the ensuing decade people have come and gone largely without incident, we get it, life changes, interests change, dreams and goals shift and girls and photographers leave.  Most of the time amiably, occasionally not, but I genuinely wish everyone well. 

The non-compete clause, honestly when I started the company I went off of Playboy’s release form, I was 24 had never done this before and thought that seemed like the industry standard.  We thought it was too confusing when it was challenged and we changed our release form in 2006 and it has been the same super simple, clear easy to read contract since then you can see it here - https://gmail123456.box.com/s/qbmj1f9pr3w8w8wzaj5e   My intent is not to fuck anyone over, if someone decides to model for a competitor I wish them well and we part ways, end of story.  

We are up front about our policies, pay scale and use of images, if you are interested you can see the answers to most questions here: https://suicidegirls.com/model/faq/ or here https://suicidegirls.com/model/faq/photographer/  And if you need further clarification we have a 3 person staff to answer your questions, they can be directed to either modelcoordinator@suicidegirls.com, modelassist@suicidegirls.com or photographycoordinator@suicidegirls.com  If you don’t think it is a good deal for you, I get it, no hard feelings but that is what we pay and what we ask.

Then there are some who have not had great experiences and felt slighted by us, and it sucks that we can’t reach an accord.  Lithium Picnic was someone who we had a disagreement with and it took time to reach an agreement.  We eventually did settle things and he has moved on and so have we and I genuinely hope that he is doing well.  

We get that what we do is not for everyone.  We try to provide a platform where people can express themselves in a supportive community and connect with like minded people.  We try to be upfront with our expectations but sometimes people don’t agree with what we do or decisions and there is an impasse.  Sometimes I am wrong and sometimes I fuck up and I make the wrong call and the only thing to do is to try to learn from my mistakes.  I have also learned that there are sometimes though you just can’t make people happy no matter what you do.  I am trying to be a better person every day though but some days are better than others.  Generally though my reputation amongst those who have actually dealt with me in the past is positive despite what it says about me on wikipedia and I have gone through enough therapy that I am okay with that. :)

Finally you would once again like to use this opportunity to question my involvement with the company, alright I can answer that too (even if it is so fucking sexist it makes me want to scream, no man would ever have to defend his position in his own fucking company 14+ years in)  Yeah Sean is my partner and has been since we started the company and he is a pretty cool dude most of the time ;) He does council me and we do make decisions together and he is very particular about design and he and Courtney Riot who has worked with us for 12 years pretty much do all of that.  I run the day to day operations of the company, ask my staff, ask the models who come by the office, or look at my nearly 15 years of ever present history.  My staff is overwhelmingly female and I am female so that is where the female run thing comes from, because it IS female run.  I do press because I am in the office everyday and started and run the company.  

I really hope that answers all of the questions, I honestly did not mean to dodge them and I hope that you enjoy turning the tables on Richard Prince with us.  That is getting WAY more attention than I anticipated and I am going to be a bit swamped for the next few days, so I probably won’t be able to engage in follow up questions here but if you need something answered you can e-mail me, I will reply, eventually :)",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-05-27 14:52:18

No, I'm not a LoL player. Yes, I am a Dota guy - but I love you all. I love the support you show for e-sports, I love how Riot and the community has glamorized the concept over the years, and I love your dedication to the game you love. But there comes a point when you all need to collectively put your foot down.

What not enough of you guys are realizing is that it's all about ROI. You can't buy a working loading screen, or a flashy new client. You don't buy the help tab, it's just there. Even if Riot only needed to send two dudes to fix that shit on a Thursday, they'd see no returns. When they instead send 30 dudes to make a champ, you buy it. Or make a skin, you buy it. Or shuffle the meta, you'll rebuy into it. See what I'm getting at?

I'm not saying Riot is money-grubbing evil or anything, but the reality of being for-profit doesn't help. You guys need to put your money where your mouth is. On /r/Dota2, people constantly talk about boycott. Servers down? Not buying the cosmetics. Tired of Dota esports? Not buying the compendium. There are seriously strong movements of fed up people who are voting with their wallets and making changes. When Valve changed the item drop system, giving us less **free** cosmetics (boo hoo, right?), and trade restrictions were put in place, people voted with their wallets. Valve reverted a lot of the more heinous changes recently, and it's probably because it did cut into their profits.

It's not easy to stop supporting something you love, I know, but you come off as spineless when you're taken advantage of. I've seen client complaints hit the front page for years now. It doesn't take years to make a new client. Fuck, Valve has taken a year break from making major Dota 2 updates so they can finish **a new fucking engine**, all while working heavily on 3-4 different games, maintaining Steam, Steam Machines, etc. I think it's easy to see that, as an outsider, you all are being given the run around. I'm sorry guys... League of Legends is the biggest game in the world. Its players deserve better.",controversial_subreddit,0,2015-04-06 10:47:32

New Ad Type: Promoted User Posts,0,4upf11,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/,2199,1469549542.0,"**TL;DR - [here is what this ad is](https://i.redd.it/dyib2c0odmbx.png)**

Hi all,
 
We’ve been working on some new ad products. When we’re thinking about new ad products, we want to ensure that what we’re creating is non-intrusive to you guys while remaining valuable to advertisers who are interested in participating in the community.
 
In conversations with many advertisers, we often hear that Redditors have already rallied around brands and products they genuinely like, and advertisers want to know how they can be part of that. But at the same time, we want to ensure that our communities remain free and user-controlled.
 
The solution, which we’re excited to share, is a new type of advertisement that we’re calling Promoted User Posts. This will essentially let an advertiser identify an organic post that they find especially relevant to their brand or product, and promote that in the Sponsored unit you guys are already used to. 

How it works:

* A redditor creates a post with brand-relevant content
* A brand notices the post and indicates to our sales team that they’re interested in promoting the post
* Our sales team reaches out to the author of the post to get explicit permission to use the post as part of a promoted user post
* If permission is given, a promoted user post is created by copying over the content and votes of the original post into a new promoted user post. (The comments will link to the same thread.)
* The original post will remain where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.

**Note that no posts created by redditors will be used in this fashion without explicit opt-in approval from the redditor who created the post. Also - votes on the ad will not count towards karma or votes on the organic thread.**

For a screenshot of a hypothetical example, see [here](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png). (Note that Jenga is not a real advertiser at this time.)

Both of these changes will go live on Thursday, August 4. We’ll be speaking with mod teams ahead of time before any user promoted posts go live in their subreddits.

While we’re launching this new avenue for generating more Reddit revenue, we’ll also be shutting down a revenue generating experiment. Our experiment with [affiliate links](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) has ended for the time being. We’ve decided that focusing our energies on advertising is more congruent with our long term strategy.

Thanks for reading, and happy redditing!

Cheers,

u/starfishjenga

**FAQ**

**Q: I don’t want my content used as an advertisement, how do I avoid this?**
No content will be turned into a promoted post without the submitter’s explicit permission. If you don’t want this to happen, either don’t answer or say no when you’re asked.

**Q: What does the promoted by link point to?**
If a brand pays to promote a post, in the bottom right corner where it says ""promoted by"", the advertiser will be linked so that you will know who is promoting the post. Clicking on their name will link to an advertiser-determined location. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png).

**Q: What if my content was originally intended to point somewhere else? Do advertisers have the right to change that? Wouldn’t this change the context of the pre-existing comments?**
Your content won’t be used in this way unless you agree to let it become a promoted user post.

If you’ve commented on a post that becomes a promoted user post, promoted user posts will simply create an additional link to these comments pages. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png).

**Q: What happens to the original votes? Is this a way for companies to juice the number of upvotes to their posts?**
The vote count from the original post will be copied to the promoted post, but any upvotes applied to the promoted post will not be copied back to the original post in order to preserve the integrity of the ranking algorithm.

**Q: What happens to the original post?**
The original post still remains where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.

**Q: What does the link in the promoted post point to?**
Promoting a post does not change the destination of the original link. If it was a self post, it goes to the self post comments page. If it was a link post, it goes to the link destination, same as before. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png)

**Q: Is there a way for us to view where our content was promoted?**
If your content is chosen for promotion and you accept, we’ll give you a link to the promoted user post.

**Q: Do we get anything in return for agreeing to have our post promoted?**
This may vary across content and across time as we figure out what makes the most sense. It will generally take the form of Gold membership for some amount of time.

**Q: Won’t this encourage more users to submit content containing brands (and more fuss from /r/HailCorporate over “shilling”)?**
We don’t believe the rewards on offer are enough to change people’s behavior in this case, but we’ll keep an eye on it and deal with any problems that arise.

We would like to take the opportunity to remind everyone that when AskReddit shut down it was related to issues of mod-admin communication that had been a concern since before Ellen was the CEO. We in no way intended this as a result.

The admins have been extremely positive and appear to be working hard towards giving us better tools and communicating better. We, in particular, want to thank /u/krispykrackers and /u/deimorz for those efforts. Here's to a more positive relationship moving forward.

More importantly, we want to remind you about [“Remembering the Human.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)

It’s a simple concept, which many of us are guilty of forgetting sometimes, but there is no better time than now to stress the importance of it. We wish Ellen the best of luck in her future ventures and are hopeful of the future for the community.

Removing harassing subreddits,0,39bpam,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/,28709,1433959311.0,"Today we are announcing a change in community management on reddit. Our goal is to enable as many people as possible to have authentic conversations and share ideas and content on an open platform. We want as little involvement as possible in managing these interactions but will be involved when needed to protect privacy and free expression, and to prevent harassment.

It is not easy to balance these values, especially as the Internet evolves. We are learning and hopefully improving as we move forward. We want to be open about our involvement:
We will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to [harass](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) individuals when moderators don’t take action. We’re banning behavior, not ideas.

Today we are removing five subreddits that break our reddit rules based on their harassment of individuals. If a subreddit has been banned for harassment, you will see that in the ban notice. The only banned subreddit with more than 5,000 subscribers is r/fatpeoplehate.

To report a subreddit for harassment, please email us at contact@reddit.com or [send a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com).

We are continuing to add to our team to manage community issues, and we are making incremental changes over time. We want to make sure that the changes are working as intended and that we are incorporating your feedback when possible. Ultimately, we hope to have less involvement, but right now, we know we need to do better and to do more. 

While we do not always agree with the content and views expressed on the site, we do protect the right of people to express their views and encourage actual conversations according to the [rules of reddit](https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

Thanks for working with us. Please keep the feedback coming.

I'm Jill Stein and I'm running for president of the United States of America on the Green Party ticket. I plan to cancel student debt, provide head-to-toe healthcare to everyone, stop our expanding wars and end systemic racism. My Green New Deal will halt climate change while providing living-wage full employment by transitioning the United States to 100 percent clean, renewable energy by 2030. I'm a medical doctor, activist and mother on fire. Ask me anything!

 7:30 pm - Hi folks. Great talking with you. Thanks for your heartfelt concerns and questions. Remember your vote can make all the difference in getting a true people's party to the critical 5% threshold, where the Green Party receives federal funding and ballot status to effectively challenge the stranglehold of corporate power in the 2020 presidential election. 

Please go to jill2016.com or fb/twitter drjillstein for more. Also, tune in to my debate with Gary Johnson on Monday, Oct 31 and Tuesday, Nov 1 on Tavis Smiley on pbs. 

Reject the lesser evil and fight for the great good, like our lives depend on it. Because they do. 

Don't waste your vote on a failed two party system. Invest your vote in a real movement for change. 

We can create an America and a world that works for all of us, that puts people, planet and peace over profit.  The power to create that world is not in our hopes. It's not in our dreams. It's in our hands! 

Signing off till the next time. Peace up!

As such, beginning today r/baseball will temporarily be added as a default community to users in the US and Canada for the remainder of the fall classic, which is expected to end by early November at the latest.

What does being a default community entail, you ask? Defaults are the set of communities displayed on the front page of reddit to logged out users, as well as to logged in users who have never altered their subreddit subscriptions. This means posts from r/baseball will begin to appear on the front page for these users through the end of the World Series.

*But … I hate baseball and don’t want to see it on my front page.*

I regret to inform you that there is, in fact, [no crying in baseball](https://i.redd.it/gt2irz27xvrx.gif). However, we are aware that not everyone finds baseball to be the perfect combination of skill, athleticism, and statistical analysis. For those of you who do not wish to see r/baseball on their front page, simply visit the subreddit and click the “unsubscribe” button.

"Transparency is important to us, and today, we take another step forward.",7248,35uyil,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/35uyil/transparency_is_important_to_us_and_today_we_take/,4755,1431543315.0,"In January of this year, we published our first [transparency report](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/01/reddits-first-transparency-report.html). In an effort to continue moving forward, we are changing how we respond to legal takedowns. In 2014, the vast majority of the [content reddit removed was for copyright and trademark reasons](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014#wiki_requests_for_removal_of_user_information), and 2015 is shaping up to be no different.

Previously, when we removed content, we had to remove **everything**: link or self text, comments, all of it. When that happened, you might have come across a comments page that had nothing more than [this, surprised and censored Snoo](http://i.imgur.com/FSXEP66.png).

There would be no reason, no information, just a surprised, censored Snoo. Not even a ""discuss this on reddit,"" which is rather un-reddit-like.

Today, this changes. 

**Effective immediately,** we're replacing the use of censored Snoo and moving to an approach that lets us preserve content that hasn't specifically been legally removed (like comment threads), and clearly identifies that we, as reddit, INC, removed the content in question.

Let us pretend we have this post I made on reddit, suspiciously titled ""Test post, please ignore"", as seen [in its original state here](http://i.imgur.com/Fn5cQFu.png), featuring one of my cats. Additionally, there is a comment on that post which is the first paragraph of this post.

Should we receive a [valid DMCA request](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement#section_dmca) for this content and deem it legally actionable, rather than being greeted with censored Snoo and no other relevant information, visitors to the post instead will now see [a message stating that we, as admins of reddit.com, removed the content and a brief reason why](http://i.imgur.com/gcwz5ks.png). 

A more detailed, although still abridged, version of the notice will be posted to /r/ChillingEffects, and a sister post submitted to chillingeffects.org.

You can view an example of a removed post and comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChillingEffects/comments/35urvq/test_post_please_ignore/).

We hope these changes will provide more value to the community and provide as little interruption as possible when we receive these requests. We are committed to being as transparent as possible and empowering our users with more information.

Finally, as this is a relatively major change, we'll be posting a variation of this post to multiple subreddits. Apologies if you see this announcement in a couple different shapes and sizes.

Time to talk,14402,2fpdax,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2fpdax/time_to_talk/,8837,1410076177.0,"Alright folks, [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2foivo/every_man_is_responsible_for_his_own_soul/) has pretty obviously devolved and we're not getting anywhere. The blame for that definitely lies with us. We're trying to explain some of what has been going on here, but the simultaneous banning of that set of subreddits entangled in this situation has hurt our ability to have that conversation with you, the community. A lot of people are saying what we're doing here reeks of bullshit, and I don't blame them.


I'm not going to ask that you agree with me, but I hope that reading this will give you a better understanding of the decisions we've been poring over constantly over the past week, and perhaps give the community some deeper insight and understanding of what is happening here. I would ask, but obviously not require, that you read this fully and carefully before responding or voting on it. I'm going to give you the very raw breakdown of what has been going on at reddit, and it is likely to be coloured by my own personal opinions. All of us working on this over the past week are fucking exhausted, including myself, so you'll have to forgive me if this seems overly dour.


Also, as an aside, my main job at reddit is systems administration. I take care of the servers that run the site. It isn't my job to interact with the community, but I try to do what I can. I'm certainly not the best communicator, so please feel free to ask for clarification on anything that might be unclear.


With that said, here is what has been happening at reddit, inc over the past week.


A very shitty thing happened this past Sunday. A number of very private and personal photos were stolen and spread across the internet. The fact that these photos belonged to celebrities increased the interest in them by orders of magnitude, but that in no way means they were any less harmful or deplorable. If the same thing had happened to anyone you hold dear, it'd make you sick to your stomach with grief and anger.


When the photos went out, they inevitably got linked to on reddit. As more people became aware of them, we started getting a huge amount of traffic, which broke the site in several ways.


That same afternoon, we held an internal emergency meeting to figure out what we were going to do about this situation. Things were going pretty crazy in the moment, with many folks out for the weekend, and the site struggling to stay afloat. We had some immediate issues we had to address. First, the amount of traffic hitting this content was breaking the site in various ways. Second, we were already getting DMCA and takedown notices by the owners of these photos. Third, if we were to remove anything on the site, whether it be for technical, legal, or ethical obligations, it would likely result in a backlash where things kept getting posted over and over again, thwarting our efforts and possibly making the situation worse.


The decisions which we made amidst the chaos on Sunday afternoon were the following: I would do what I could, including disabling functionality on the site, to keep things running (this was a pretty obvious one). We would handle the DMCA requests as they came in, and recommend that the rights holders contact the company hosting these images so that they could be removed. We would also continue to monitor the site to see where the activity was unfolding, especially in regards to /r/all (we didn't want /r/all to be primarily covered with links to stolen nudes, deal with it). I'm not saying all of these decisions were correct, or morally defensible, but it's what we did based on our best judgement in the moment, and our experience with similar incidents in the past.


In the following hours, a lot happened. I had to break /r/thefappening a few times to keep the site from completely falling over, which as expected resulted in an immediate creation of a new slew of subreddits. Articles in the press were flying out and we were getting comment requests left and right. Many community members were understandably angered at our lack of action or response, and made that known in various ways. 

Later that day we were alerted that some of these photos depicted minors, which is where we have drawn a clear line in the sand. In response we immediately started removing things on reddit which we found to be linking to those pictures, and also recommended that the image hosts be contacted so they could be removed more permanently. We do not allow links on reddit to child pornography or images which sexualize children. If you disagree with that stance, and believe reddit cannot draw that line while also being a platform, I'd encourage you to leave.

This nightmare of the weekend made myself and many of my coworkers feel pretty awful. I had an obvious responsibility to keep the site up and running, but seeing that all of my efforts were due to a huge number of people scrambling to look at stolen private photos didn't sit well with me personally, to say the least. We hit new traffic milestones, ones which I'd be ashamed to share publicly. Our general stance on this stuff is that reddit is a platform, and there are times when platforms get used for very deplorable things. We take down things we're legally required to take down, and do our best to keep the site getting from spammed or manipulated, and beyond that we *try* to keep our hands off. Still, in the moment, seeing what we were seeing happen, it was hard to see much merit to that viewpoint.


As the week went on, press stories went out and debate flared everywhere. A lot of focus was obviously put on us, since reddit was clearly one of the major places people were using to find these photos. We continued to receive DMCA takedowns as these images were constantly rehosted and linked to on reddit, and in response we continued to remove what we were legally obligated to, and beyond that instructed the rights holders on how to contact image hosts. 

Meanwhile, we were having a huge amount of debate internally at reddit, inc. A lot of members on our team could not understand what we were doing here, why we were continuing to allow ourselves to be party to this flagrant violation of privacy, why we hadn't made a statement regarding what was going on, and how on earth we got to this point. It was messy, and continues to be. The pseudo-result of all of this debate and argument has been that we should continue to be as open as a platform as we can be, and that while we in no way condone or agree with this activity, we should not intervene beyond what the law requires. The arguments for and against are numerous, and this is not a comfortable stance to take in this situation, but it is what we have decided on.



That brings us to today. After painfully arriving at a stance internally, we felt it necessary to make a statement on the reddit blog. We could have let this die down in silence, as it was already tending to do, but we felt it was critical that we have this conversation with our community. If you haven't read it yet, **[please do so](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html)**.

So, we posted the message in the blog, and then we obliviously did something which heavily confused that message: We banned /r/thefappening and related subreddits. The confusion which was generated in the community was obvious, immediate, and massive, and we even had internal team members surprised by the combination. Why are we sending out a message about how we're being open as a platform, and not changing our stance, and then immediately banning the subreddits involved in this mess?


The answer is probably not satisfying, but it's the truth, and the only answer we've got. The situation we had in our hands was the following:  These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occurring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the [site rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It's obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.

---

Now, after all of the context from above, I'd like to respond to some of the common questions and concerns which folks are raising. To be extremely frank, I find *some* of the lines of reasoning that have generated these questions to be batshit insane. Still, in the vacuum of information which we have created, I recognize that we have given rise to much of this strife. As such I'll try to answer even the things which I find to be the most off-the-wall.

Q: You're only doing this in response to pressure from the public/press/celebrities/Conde/Advance/other!

A: The press and nature of this incident obviously made this issue extremely public, but it was not the reason why we did what we did. If you read all of the above, hopefully you can be recognize that the actions we have taken were our own, for our own internal reasons. I can't force anyone to believe this of course, you'll simply have to decide what you believe to be the truth based on the information available to you.


Q: Why aren't you banning these other subreddits which contain deplorable content?!

A: We remove what we're required to remove by law, and what violates any [rules](http://www.reddit.com) which we have set forth. Beyond that, we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible, and to let the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them. I believe the [blog post](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html) speaks very well to this.

We have banned /r/TheFappening and related subreddits, for reasons I outlined above.



Q: You're doing this because of the IAmA app launch to please celebs!

A: No, I can say absolutely and clearly that the IAmA app had zero bearing on our course of decisions regarding this event. I'm sure it is exciting and intriguing to think that there is some clandestine connection, but it's just not there.


Q: Are you planning on taking down all copyrighted material across the site?

A: We take down what we're required to by law, which may include thumbnails, in response to valid DMCA takedown requests. Beyond that we tell claimants to contact whatever host is actually serving content. This policy will not be changing.



Q: You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits! Give it back / Give it to charity!

A: This is a tricky issue, one which we haven't figured out yet and that I'd welcome input on. Gold was purchased by our users, to give to other users. Redirecting their funds to a random charity which the original payer may not support is not something we're going to do. We also do not feel that it is right for us to decide that certain things should not receive gold. The user purchasing it decides that. We don't hold this stance because we're money hungry (the amount of money in question is small).




That's all I have. Please forgive any confusing bits above, it's very late and I've written this in urgency. I'll be around for as long as I can to answer questions in the comments.

Let's talk content. AMA.,14101,3djjxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/,21630,1437076815.0,"We started Reddit to be—as we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks—“The front page of the Internet.” Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: “because I don’t want that content on our site.”

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn’t have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we’re careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit—or at least say on our public pages—in the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone’s private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say ""I don't like this group of people."" It's not ok to say, ""I'm going to kill this group of people."")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don’t pollute people’s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor’s listings, and we think it’ll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We’ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don’t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it’s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I’d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this ""Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.""

edit: added an example to clarify our concept of ""harm""
edit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy

We are the WikiLeaks staff. Despite our editor Julian Assange's increasingly precarious situation WikiLeaks continues publishing,28900,5c8u9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/,14648,1478796488.0,"EDIT: Thanks guys that was great. We need to get back to work now, but thank you for joining us. 

You can follow for any updates on Julian Assange's case at his [legal defence website](https://justice4assange.com/) and support his defence [here](https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/45DZ1). You can suport WikiLeaks, which is tax deductible in Europe and the United States, [here](https://shop.wikileaks.org/donate).

And keep reading and researching the documents!

We are the [WikiLeaks](https://wikileaks.org/) staff, including [Sarah Harrison](http://www.vogue.com/11122973/sarah-harrison-edward-snowden-wikileaks-nsa/). Over the last months we have published over 25,000 [emails from the DNC](https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/), over 30,000 [emails from Hillary Clinton](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/), over 50,000 [emails from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/) and many chapters of the secret controversial [Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA)](https://wikileaks.org/tisa/).

The Clinton campaign unsuccessfully tried to claim that our publications are inaccurate. WikiLeaks’ decade-long pristine record for authentication remains. [As Julian said](https://wikileaks.org/Assange-Statement-on-the-US-Election.html): ""Our key publications this round have even been proven through the [cryptographic signatures](https://www.wikileaks.org/DKIM-Verification.html) of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them.""

We have been very excited to see all the great citizen journalism taking place [here at Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/) on these publications, especially on the [DNC email archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/DNCleaks/) and the [Podesta emails](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5a3x7l/wikileaks_central_station_on_rthe_donald/?st=ivcib4ow&sh=895ef2e0).

Recently, the White House, in an effort to silence its most critical publisher during an election period, pressured for our editor Julian Assange's publications to be stopped. The government of Ecuador then issued a statement saying that it had ""temporarily"" [severed Mr. Assange's internet link over the US election](http://www.cancilleria.gob.ec/en/official-communique_2/). As of the 10th his internet connection has not been restored. There has been no explanation, which is concerning.

WikiLeaks has the necessary contingency plans in place to keep publishing. WikiLeaks staff, continue to monitor the situation closely.

"[Announcement] With your approval, I would like to transform this subreddit into a great community",390,f1emn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pictures/comments/f1emn/announcement_with_your_approval_i_would_like_to/,107,1294900902.0,"/r/pics is the largest of all the subreddits here on this site, with a whopping 500K subscribers.

/r/pictures has a mere 10K subscribers, and the moderator doesn't appear to be an active member of the community anymore.

By upvoting this post, you are supporting me so that I may ask the admins to be a moderator here, and to renovate it towards my vision.

*****

The goal:

>I have long been fascinated by the potential of reddit's wonderful code. This place is amazing. It's a social experiment that is working pretty well, but we need to step up our game and be smart about how we organize our communities. The admins allow and encourage us to create and build and discuss things like this, but people don't really do that.

>Reddit is quickly becoming one of the most trafficked websites on the internet, around the globe, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In my opinion, the largest subreddit--/r/pics/--is moderated insufficiently, and with policies that are either insufficient, or not enforced. Personally, I don't feel safe opening links there when I am browsing in public, due to the lax stance on NSFW content. I also constantly wish that my reports meant something, and that policies were enforced. For the amount of people who view links there, I really feel like it has gotten out of hand, and this is an experiment to see if anyone is interested in a more controlled and logical approach to organization, discussion, and civility. My policy on similar-subreddits will help keep this place have fresh interesting content, and it will also help grow and populate smaller subreddits who are larger than my 2K threshold. I honestly believe this experiment could revolutionize reddit, by focussing on categorization and policies, and it will also help wonderful communities here grow. 

*****

These are the rules that would be used by the subreddit if I became moderator:

* Derivative posts should be kept within the comments of the original post. If the post is simply derivative of another post and belongs in the comments of that post rather than on it's own post, it will be removed.

* Copycat titles will not be tolerated. 

* This is a SFW subreddit. Content deemed NSFW by moderators or users will not be tolerated, even if labelled.

* Vague titles will generally not be tolerated. Titles are a descriptive heading that helps recognize a link, identify the contents of a link, recognize a repost, and greatly help users find the post again using search.

* Direct image links are preferred (if the original source of an image can't be found), as links to webpages can be deemed as 'blogspam'. Tineye.com can help you find the original source of an image, or larger resolutions.  Watermarks are allowed, as long as they are not large, and do not take away from the image.

* Links which are deemed as far too relevant to a particular subreddit with over 2K subscribers will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to /politics, /gifs, /worldnews, and /photocritique. A list of related subreddits will be created in the sidebar.

* Self-posts will generally not be tolerated. Text-only images will not be tolerated. 

* Spam will not be tolerated.

Violations of these policies in the sidebar will result in your submission being removed from the listings, which you may attempt to appeal by messaging the moderators. Multiple abuses may result in a ban from the subreddit. These will be warned ahead of time, and avoided where possible.

Moderators:

* No moderator is permitted to moderate any subreddits with a larger number of subscribers. This policy is to keep moderators fresh-blooded, uncontroversial, and focussed on their responsibilities.

* Moderators are required to message a user the specific reason if they are banned from the subreddit.

* Moderators will be sworn in with a boilerplate comment that promises the users they will act according to their responsibilities, or face the consequence of removal. Nominations will occasionally be made to acquire a new moderator. No more than 10 moderators will ever coexist (subject to change at 100K subscribers).

Users:

* When you report a submission, if the reason is not extremely obvious, please make a comment that describes the issue. 

* Your participation is valuable. Please submit, vote, and comment. Please follow rediquette.

Policies will be linked from the sidebar, and a large effort will be made to notify you if any of the policies change.

The stylesheet of this subreddit may change.

*****

Feel free to leave questions or comments below. This post will not be edited unless explicitly noted in an 'edit' below.

Edit1: point 5 was edited to express preferability to original sources of images, as per `nebopolis`'s suggestion below

Edit2: `Band_B` pointed out ambiguity in what I meant by 'ban'. That part has been revised.

Edit3: `raldi` has suggested that I replace the word 'ban' with 'remove from the listings' to clear up the ambiguity.

Edit4: `raldi` has notified me that a submission should not be reported if a comment has been reported, due to the way they factor into the spam filter.

Edit5: `CrasyMike` has suggested that instead of a 7 day period limit for derivative posts, I should use a judgement-call type of policy. It has been replaced above.

Edit6: Thank you for your support. Hueypriest has instated me as a moderator. I will try my best to keep this place sane. When my goals are reached and this subreddit is in a stable state according to my vision, I will remove myself as moderator.

Again, thank you.",top_subreddit,0,2011-01-13 00:41:42

Schizophrenic Musings on Solipsism,3,aqk56d,https://www.reddit.com/r/original/comments/aqk56d/schizophrenic_musings_on_solipsism/,0,1550153515.0,"When your brain is littered with a record of delusions and false memories, one of your central life questions is whether you create reality or are merely a fool. I've long sought to resolve this question because, frankly, I'd far rather be a mere fool than creator of the sorts of horrors that psychosis has forever put into my head by means of my subjectivity. That question devolves on solipsism. Fundamentally, either the world I experience is my creature, or I'm the speckiest of specks of dust in it. The elaborate reasoning needed to establish that assertion philosophically is fairly old hat and not worth repeating in a Reddit post.

I've tried to draw comfort from the very occasional reality of being surprised. My contact with other peope has been slightest of slightness in a largely isolated fantasy life, but from time to time another person will say something that makes me go ""Hmm."" Those moments, which I've heard the caregivers of people with autism describe observationally as finally losing their patience and shouting the obvious at the person they care for, with surprisingly high effectiveness, have from my side felt like epiphanies when another human being in the guise of a deity has said something that had entirely eluded me. The competitive deceitfulness and secretiveness of people has made those moments extremely few in my life, but in retrospect I treasure all of them. And getting back to what I was even saying in the first place in this paragraph, those moments feel like definitive counterexamples that I am entirely the creator of my own experience, but rather that There Are Others. Tying that in with what's long-established by credible thinkers about creation of one's own experience either being absolute or nonexistent, I can logically conclude that I don't create a damned thing. It all comes to me  by means of other agencies, and I am either a product or a happenstance and no more than that.

Yet a speck, being infinitesimal, can consist only of the assertion that it Is. That stands in absolute contradiction to its reality as product or happenstance. For that reason I've never succeeded in being comforted by surprises for particularly long. For the most part, I've rapidly reverted to that infinitesimal point of assertion, which is to say of  Being, without which, well, d'oh, I wouldn't Be at all. So back I always go to the inner pressure to be solipsistic and give credence to stupidities about the world that are demonstrably false, and which make me abject and wretched about what never happened and what no one did, least of all me. It's a fight no human being can possibly win, because it's part of the irresolvable stalemate of The War of Self Against Self, which is lifelong and during which there can be no stable, enduring ceasefires. Or maybe that's just having schizophrenia. How am I even supposed to know?

    These Beasts were all dead.
    
    The cavern was dim, but Peshishtu's vision had adjusted quickly. Survival does that to you.
    
    Survival also gradually robs you of your mind. You can find food anywhere, turn any trash and ruin into a tool or accessory, but you can't think about it. So Peshistu gazed and the huge, sprawling forms, thrown over each other amidst shattered furniture and decoratives, and saw only scavenge.
    
    The most important person of her generation started her ascent by pawing through limbs and ruin for what she could use to stay alive a little longer. She may have been fourteen, but maybe sixteen, or maybe twelve. Gaunt from the ruination left behind by The Shaking of the Earth all too recently, her hair uncut and matted and tangled because washing it wasn't even a thought. Soft prosperity grooms itself. Hard survival looks for food sources.

Peshishtu growled deep in her lungs at not finding anything. Then, as if in response, she glimpsed something that to her meant “cut.” She picked up the foot-long sticklike thing and her sharpened vision saw its long-sharp edge. She smiled so broadly that she leered at this thing of the Beasts that had been sharp since before her birth and would stay sharp long after her death. All she'd have to do is find a way to carry it, avoid losing it, and use it.

    That leer was the birth of her smile. In time she would be a beauty because of it. But what is the trigger of greatness? *Rlishishemarlashashtesh!* *What does greatness even look like?* ",top_subreddit,0,2019-03-05 13:06:32
Yarks,2,as8h70,https://www.reddit.com/r/original/comments/as8h70/yarks/,0,1550567582.0,"	In the Twenty-Second Century, the world has a big problem with yarks.

	Nobody remembers what the acronym “IARC” meant when it was first coined, but people know far more than they want to about the tiny minority of humans it describes. Yarks are the materialist-atheist immortals: they regenerate. I mean, how else are you going to define immortality if you’re a materialist atheist? Makes total sense.

	The problem with yarks is that anybody who lives for more than about six generations or 120 years, which is the maximum lifespan for normal human tissues, becomes such an incredible butthole that they’re impossible to get along with. Since you can’t kill yarks, you have to figure out what else to do with them—and other solutions that have been attempted have been disastrous.

	Simply confining a yark with no thought to his experience of confinement gives you the Ancient Greek Gods all over again. Those had been yarks whom exasperated Ancients had simply buried in loose soil. The explanation for those yarks acquiring divine-seeming powers is very technical, but it has to do with regeneration adjusting to the environment. It’s why the sarcophagi of some Egyptian mummies will never be opened. Yeech! … Don’t think too much about it, as it gets even weirder than that.

Anyway, those immured yarks created Mount Olympos as a dining room with no exits and with just enough room for a table, just enough chairs, and Zeus’s dais. Try putting a bunch of deranged crazies together in a sealed dining room with nothing to do until the end of time except chat pleasantly because that’s all they have! Since nobody wants the Twenty-Second-Century equivalent of Sisyphus to be a real guy in a real place on Earth, or for the Twenty-Second-Century equivalent of Medusa to be a real monster somewhere real on earth for lost travelers to blunder into the lair of, or for the Twenty-Second-Century equivalent of hades to be some real shitty place under the real earth where real dead souls go, this idea of simply locking the yarks up in the Bastille is right out. 

(Oh, yeah, the Bastille was thought to be a better solution for yarks than burying them alive, until the 18 yarks in the Bastille gave us, first, the awful behavior of the late-monarchic French aristocracy, and then that guillotining festival that followed the French Revolution. A renaissance of the Bastille for yarks is right out.)

What has to be found is some way to make sure the yarks aren’t harming real people while at the same time they aren’t so tormented that they acquire divine-seeming powers. Part of the solution that is being attempted in the fabulously technologically advanced Twenty-Second-Century is a type of holodeck where features come into existence when the yark first has an opportunity to sense them. What’s around the corner of a hallway doesn’t even exist until the yark gets to the corner and sees what’s around the corner; and, when he sees it, it comes into existence. There are so many potential features in this holodeck’s databanks that the chance of a Yark ever finding an exit, or encountering another yark, are zero, yet the yark will never get bored of the same old walls and the same old doors and rooms.

But that’s not enough. Since the yark is going to be alone until the universe reaches heat death, there has to be stuff for him to do that he can do alone that keeps him sufficiently occupied for that long. Well, yarks are a heirloomy bunch, as can be expected given their ridiculous ages. Some were around back when the land in Texas was still part of Mexico. Just use the fabulous fiction-writing software of the Twenty-Second-Century to have heirlooms pop up as needed and have the yarks cheerfully prowling around figuring out what the stories behind the heirlooms are.

But wait a minute. You’re not a yark. What are you even doing in there?

Oh, crap. Well, don’t panic. We’ll help get you out. Follow the storylines. And if the current storyline bores you, go find a different heirloom to start a new one. We’re tweaking things to get you too the exit, but we have to handle the yarks at the same time, so we can’t be completely direct and obvious about it. It’s just not possible. And one thing that’s super not possible is having anything exist until you have a chance to sense it. Don’t waste time wondering what’s beyond that door you just encountered. There won’t be anything until you open the door, and then there will be whatever we can safely put there to help you toward the exit. It will be far from perfect, but we really do want to help. You mean a lot to us.

Oh, and avoid the yarks at all costs. If there’s the slightest chance you’ll encounter one, make damned sure you don’t. Regeneration adjusts to the environment. Don’t try to find out what that even means. You don’t want to. And we’ll help you make sure that you don’t.

Good luck to you. No matter who wins the office pool on you making it out alive, we’ll make sure they give you half the money.

&#x200B;

	Whoever wrote that is obviously crazy. Or whatever wrote that. There are no “yarks.” There’s only some sick mind playing sick games with the player character. And the real objective of the game is to find out what’s “really” going on and thwart it. That way lies true freedom.

	The real game engine can pseudorandomly select from a pool of rooms with the configuration of rooms refreshed for each game. With a pool of 300 rooms there are 44,850! (factorial) possible different games ranging in size from a maximum of 300 rooms to a minimum of one. That’s a very large number of potentially different gameplays, with the vast majority having some significant uniqueness, or several significant uniquenesses. The key is to be broad-minded about what “room” means. A room can be anything from a staircase to a city street to a forest to a lake. Yes, it’s a huge amount of data, but the standards and practices of game design already have mechanisms in place for databasing a large variety of registers. The game art would be the real bulk of storage, which is why a cloud-based deployment should be considered.

I personally favour the old turn-based games, but a real-time game is feasible. A graphically rich text game could also be entertaining for the player and easier to implement on mobile devices. In a text-based game the art would be everything and would require enough of a budget to retain competent graphic artists, but the engine itself would be nearly trivial to code.

The storylines for the clues would have to be modular, and that’s where the game design would do its heavy lifting. Modular fiction with many branches is very, very difficult to pull off because of the nature of storytelling. That would require some forethought and a team of talented writers.

The simplest approach might be to have the player’s mind fill in the details of any apparent inconsistencies. If the character is walking along the shore in the wilderness and encounters a large boulder, that boulder can variously be an obstacle to circumvent, a token of the deep geological past, quarrying material, a potential sculpture of a large animal for the character to chisel, a memory of the player having met the love of their life at such a boulder, and almost anything else within human experience. From the viewpoint of game engine it would still be just that same rock. The language of the description would have to be suggestive enough to have the player’s mind supply all of the necessary details to make the character encountering that boulder a rich experience.

Therefore:

&#x200B;

Exercise for the Game Design Team:

Have your graphic artist draw a basic sketch of a boulder at the edge of a body of water.

The whole team brainstorm a list of how a player’s mind might interpret their character encountering that stone while walking along the edge of the body of water.

The graphic artists and writing teams work together to add both graphical and linguistic detail that will be differently suggestive to different players based on the players’ experiences over the course of the players’ lives.

The coders code an appropriate way to present that boulder graphic and the text within the context of a game the player is playing with their current character.",top_subreddit,0,2019-02-19 03:13:02

Hillario knew that that wouldn't keep his head still enough for the Printer. After six generations of life, his tremors were unavoidable. But stillness was down to the Trust between the levels of recursion of Reality; the Trust that is Life.

So Hillario Trusted, and heard the loud \_snack\_ as the Printer captured his retinae. Already Prendergast was at the Printer, those fine hands the size of hams running the fanfold between their fingers as it emerged from between the drum and the platen, crammed with a long lifetime of memories.

Hillario had already made peace with having been no more than a data storage device, like the ""flash drives"" from his grandfather's childhood. Everything he had felt truly mattered, all those lived experiences that had devoured his fragile heart, had been mere distractions to prevent him from corrupting the data he'd been storing until it could be retrieved. That much was fine. He was finally ready to let go, to cease the deathless struggle to live that always ended in death.

Then he noticed that Prendergast wasn't a woman any longer. She, or rather it, was a machine on wheels.

The levels had betrayed him once again. It was the nature of Trust to be betrayed. And he felt himself slipping away with too little time to puzzle out what this level of Reality was.

""Thank you for your memories,"" said Prendergast in a voice like the frying of flux on trillions of solder joints. That voice reminded him of something from a museum, an old relic of his grandfather's days. That thing had had a name. \_What had been its name????\_

It was no good. He was slipping away too quickly to recall. He began to make peace with never having known anything.

Then, in the last infinitesimal moment of his life, the name began to come to him.

\_Alex...\_

And then half of an ""a.""

The other half would never be.

The Architect : 

Ch1 - Frustration

Along the coast in the Gulf of Alaska, was a prison surrounded by towering gates, watch towers, and barbed wire. Sentinels patrolled every entrance and exit.   
This prison contained America's most vile criminals. A man named Vincent Maine was among them.   
John Hudson, the director of the Quartz agency, stationed in the deserts of Nevada, was a well-to-do spy who captured said vile criminals. 

John arrived to the prison by a helicopter to pay Vincent a visit. At the front entrance a guard greeted him nearby.

""Hello sir. Right this way,"" she said and led him inside.

Vincent was lying on a small bed in his containment room. The room was all white, lit with fluorescent lights. A large glass window presented the other side of the room, which was just a door, and a member of the prison staff would occasionally walk by and peep in. Vincent was expecting John to walk through that door.

He contemplated his failed attempt to save America from itself. He lost his daughter and a number of people who stood by him in the process. Now, he was a man with a death sentence. He was to be executed by morning. The reason why - Vincent was responsible for murdering a great number of America's political figures.

The door opened. Just then, John, his former best friend walked into the containment room while accompanied by a guard. Vincent closed his eyes and a sly smile played on his lips.

""All of this, and for what?"" John began with vexation in his tone. ""After everything we've been through, what were you trying to prove?"" He was enraged, confused and heartbroken all at the same time.

Vincent stayed silent and still. 

Then John shouted furiously, ""Aaron was just a kid!!!"" And his voice echoed.

Vincent unclosed his eyes and sat up on the edge of his bed. He looked John in the eyes with a deadpan expression, and John raised his eyebrows expectantly. Vincent couldn't care less about anyone or anything at the moment.

""Do you seriously think that I care?"" He asked. ""Because I don't.""

John's fingers went deeper into his palms as his eyes began to glisten with tears. 

Then Vincent straightened up and took a breath.  ""All you had to do was listen. But no...you just wanted to *save* the day. I know you all meant well, but I was trying to do the actual saving. I was saving you all from yourselves. But you were too blind and stubborn to see it. *I* was trying to make everything greater. Greater for everyone. A lot of good people died because of you...you're the one that got Aaron killed, John.""

That's when John snapped. He went inside the containment room, charging at Vincent.

In an instant, John had Vincent on the floor, giving him repeated heavy blows to the face. The guard tried to stop him, but it only earned her a nasty right hook.   
As John continued to beat his fist into Vincent's face, Vincent couldn't help but laugh maniacally. The harder he laughed, the harder John beat him. John wanted Vincent to understand his pain, although he low-key knew it was no use. All the frustration lingered within John. If he killed Vincent, he would still feel upset. 

It wasn't long before John's hands were painted crimson red with blood. He wasn't sure if it was his or Vincent's. He wasn't too sure if he had killed Vincent after the beating he gave him.  
Guards rushed in on the scene and found Vincent's unconscious body on the floor. He was awfully bloody and bruised. He had a plump bottom lip and both of his eyes were swollen shut. The guards didn't know what to do.  
John sat in a corner crying huge tears, and there was the guard with a bloody nose who endured John's nasty right hook, lying on the floor.

""Dear, God,"" one guard whispered.

The meaning of PAIN,1,avu45j,https://www.reddit.com/r/original/comments/avu45j/the_meaning_of_pain/,0,1551377056.0,"This is just a snippet that reflects my thinking aloud of the physical meaning of 'SELF' and how it helped me overcome physical pain. To give a background about myself (so the context is clear), I am from India with some exposure to western culture (that is, experiencing culture in the West) and slipping into the middle of middle-age. I am also a business man, more so an entrepreneur. A mildly successful one, at that. So, my thoughts are influenced by Indian culture & people, and I am not sure if this is felt relevant either in the West, East or the Middle-east.

&#x200B;

It is clear that I sense the world through my senses of touch, smell, sight, taste and hearing (thankfully, all of them). Just taking 'alone-time' and thinking through what constitutes me gives a feeling that there is this body that is being controlled by my mind (or more accurately, my brain), but I do not feel these two are different aspects of a being. Clearly, I feel one cannot exist without the other. That feeling is so great and given that any effect on a part of my body or mind vastly affects the other and the concern as a whole is felt. Say, you stub your toe bad enough that it has gone blue. You feel the pain almost throughout your body, though you cannot pin point where. Your mind is very aware that it is best to keep your toe out of harms way in a very deliberate manner. A larger injury may make you sick, too. But, why does this happen? It is only a small part of your body at the end of your foot that is injured, possibly not even broken. The one obvious answer is that evolution helped us to be structured that way. But it makes no sense when we have become intelligent and aware that it is only a small part of the body that may be, most times, inconsequential. The mind clearly knows that.

&#x200B;

So, to test if the mind can be controlled, I waited for the right situation. I am allergic to wasp bites. And, when I got bitten in the hand (on my little finger, actually), the entire arm got swollen. In 48 hours the pain was hitting me through my wrist onto the ulna and I was finding it difficult to bend my elbow. The whole arm was on fire, or so it felt. The only relief I could get was to place the entire arm in a bucket of ice-cold water to cool it down. The relief was temporary. Perfect situation to try some mind games, I thought. During one of those sleepless nights, I was very keen to understand where the pain was emanating from. One place was clearly where I was stung. Other than that, I could not pinpoint the exact location of the rest of the pain. To my amazement, the harder I tried to pick the location of the pain in the arm, the lesser the pain seemed to be. I am not sure how long I was trying this, because the next thing I remember is to wake up in the morning, with the searing pain back in my arm. It took me sometime to gather my wits (and complete my ablutions) before I remembered what happened the previous night. So, I was back in a quiet place all by myself and was quite persistent to understand the location of the pain through my arm. That is when I knew this is something I need to share with people. The pain became so much more bearable. This led me to think of a hypothesis.

&#x200B;

Let us assume I am an able-bodied person with normal mental abilities (which I hope I am). If I were to trim the nails of my toe and fingers, would my mind think differently? I think not. I would still think I am the same person. In this hypothesis, I am not supposed to feel pain. Without sounding gruesome, let me cut off part of my leg up to my ankle (assume the cut leg heals instantly, with no pain or no bleeding and no 'Phantom limb' syndrome). Would I be the same person? I guess so. What if, I progressed this chopping spree upwards and get both my legs amputated at the hip. I should be the same person (possibly a lot shorter, I suppose). My mind would still think whatever is left of me is still me. I would still see the world through the same eyes and feel the same warmth around me. I should feel the same way when I proceed to remove my hands.

&#x200B;

Now let me proceed to replace each of my organs with artificial machines or external support systems. For example, my kidneys are replaced by external dialysis machines. My heart is replaced by a mechanical device powered externally, etc. Would I not feel to be the same person. It still is me. If we continue with this gruesome exercise, and I am left with just the head, with blood artificially energised and pumped into my brain, I would continue to feel I am still me, though I would also feel highly straight-jacketed! I guess, this is how people would have felt when they were guillotined in France. A severed head briefly looking helplessly at the body it got detached from, till it was overcome by a sense of unconsciousness.

&#x200B;

So, from this hypothesis I am presuming (because I could have got many things wrong here), that the sense of 'self' is really originating from the brain, a tactic it has used to ensure the body never gets separated from the 'Command Centre'. So, why does it need to do this? I haven't understood the connection between this tactic and the need to preserve the DNA. Because, ultimately, it seems all life has the preservation and propagation of the gene as the only purpose.

&#x200B;

One good thing that came out of this thought process is that I last suffered a headache more than 10 years ago. It now seems a simple solution to feel the headache and try and locate the origin of the pain. The pain seems to magically disappear. Of course, if I suffer an injury, I can quite easily feel the location of the pain. But, that pain is localised and very manageable, if you know what I mean.

&#x200B;

I am hoping this snippet helps people, especially those in perennial pain, alleviate the distress and increase their quality of life.

&#x200B;

It was in VHS and the mice were claymation and all had British accents and wore clothes. There were a bunch of them and they would teach kids lessons about friendship and other stuff. The opening scenes always started the same with a orange headed puppet old lady tell us about the starting episode. Then when she was done the camera would zoom in in the mouse house door. 
I found previews of it on YouTube and a full length movie without sound. 
Am I the only one?

Last Best Decade in the US,0,4kecvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/4kecvq/last_best_decade_in_the_us/,3,1463849380.0,"The 90s were the last best decade for the USA. Kids were kids and played outside. No one was afraid of each other and parents let kids play with other kids without worry besides if they came home with a wound. Everyone was thick skinned still and could take a insult instead of being a sissy and crying about it for weeks. 90s kids had the best quality of cartoons that related to them and helped kids in those same situations. (hey Arnold) it was also the time before everything became heavily regulated on what could and couldn't be shown on tv. Not only was the economy booming in the 90s but so was society and also technology. When 9/11 happened it was basically a nail on the coffin ending the greatness the 90s built up to. Everything started to be regulated and toned down to make sure kids weren't physically or psychologically scarred from TV shows and people were afraid of each other because of terrorists. Everything started to become much more complicated than it needs to be after 9/11 and the economy took a massive dive and when the economy takes a dive, so is society.",controversial_subreddit,0,2016-05-21 11:49:40

"I was born in 1997, yet I should’ve been born in 1967 instead. I love the 1980s and I feel like I missed out on something amazing. I feel nostalgic whenever I see or listen to something associated to the 80s sometimes it makes me sad as well.",0,9wckku,https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/9wckku/i_was_born_in_1997_yet_i_shouldve_been_born_in/,33,1542014462.0,"Hey, just your common young teen here. 

If you fully read the title then you understand how much I love this decade. 

I dress like in the 80s. I exclusively listen to 1980s music and 80s remixes (today’s songs turned into 80s songs) and sometimes early 1990s music. I have the mentality of 3 decades ago. I love 80s cars. 80s movies are the best as well, etc... Basically I like everything from that time.

Now the problem is: there’s no way to truly experience it, it’s simply impossible it’s gone, forever..

I loathe the 21st century, its trends, the society’s mentality, I hate millennials and gen Z with a burning passion, 9/11 ruined a lot of things, terrorism and shootings everywhere, the music is beyond garbage, nightclubs are just pathetic, dating and love is a joke too.

People who were teens in the 80s consider me as a mere child with no experience whatsoever, they think I don’t know anything nor I belong to their generation. I’m basically a 50 year old stuck in a teenage body while missing out on childhood and adolescence. I don’t belong to any generation apparently, oh well nevermind it’s fine.

I would literally give ANYTHING to be able to make a trip to 1984 and live through the most amazing times of all. I would also get to experience big historical events such as the fall of the Iron Curtain, 1984 Olympics, tearing down the Berlin Wall etc etc... 

It would be my biggest dream, to be an 80s teen, find my love there and perhaps even have a wedding in those days. I’ve always pictured myself in an high school dance in ‘85 kissing my girlfriend and later wife during an emotional power ballad, tears of joy in our eyes, playing that same song on our wedding day too... (Search on YouTube: Moonlight - Ariana Grande 1980s remix. not an 80s song per se but still as emotional and strong as an authentic song)

I’m nostalgic for a time I’ve never been.


Thank you.

This would entail enduring several waves of intense abdominal pain.The pain would grow in intensity over a few minutes and then peak, during which you had to stand still and fight the pain while focusing on holding back the poop. After about 5 to ten waves of pain the urge to poop would subside and you wouldn’t have to poop anymore for a few hours or longer. I don’t remember why I used to do this.
