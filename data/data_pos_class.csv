I just came across this subreddit and it reminded me of a funny quote i heard from a kid years back. I was working at a Gamestop around the same time the third Star Wars movie came in Cinemas. A Star Wars game(not lego) was being marketed in our store with this big cut-out figure of Anakin vs Obi-Wan. 
One day this kid around the age of 8-10 went by and shouted excited to his mom: ""Look mom!! It's Lego Star Wars, just without the Lego!.""
It stuck with me ever since, i got a good chuckle out of it. Just felt like sharing. ",top_subreddit,1,2018-01-16 07:09:23

In my opinion this is nicely laid out and explained, however it definitely won't have the same impact like the original timeline had, which made me want to go back to the book, to browse all the cool sets.

Also the new one doesn't have the minifigures at the back of the book like the previous ones did:

One thing that I'd like to do is get a Rebel army for display. Idk if it's the inner kid in me or what, but I want to build a Rebel fleet and have an army to go along with it. 

I plan on getting the new UCS Tantive IV when it comes out, and would like to get a group of the new Rebel Fleet Troopers to go along with it. I'm not sure if one or two of the troops will come with it, but I'd like to get quite a few more. To my knowledge there is one in the Junior's Tie Fighter, but I'm not gonna pay $20 for a 77 piece set 5+ times. There will also be one in the Calendar later this year, but that'll cost even more. I found a listing on eBay of 5 for $40, but is there a website out there where I could get that many for cheaper? I'm not well versed in the culture Bricklink or anything like that.

It adds many characters that can't be freely selected and played as in the original game, as well as some that aren't even present in the original game, to the roster. This first release adds 16 characters and 7 vehicles to the roster. You can download the mod [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/551452396719702047/556939638615310358/The_Complete_Roster.zip).

**Note: Sadly, this mod is not compatible with existing saves made before installation of the mod. Any characters that unlock through clearing levels cannot be unlocked if those levels are already cleared, and if characters have been purchased in the shop in a save prior to installing this mod, the shop will break on that save.  
If you have any existing saves that you wish to keep intact but wish to try out this mod, it is advised that you back up your saves (They can be found in
`C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\LucasArts\LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga\SavedGames\`. You can put `%localappdata%` in the address bar to instantly jump to the Local folder, then navigate from there). However, as long as you don't select those saves with the mod installed, they should remain intact.**

Anyway, here's my ideas:

A Battle of Kashyyyk Clones pack, it'd have 1 91st Recon Corps, 1 41st Ranger Corps, 1 41st Elite Corp and one Wookie. It'd also come with a little turret and/or a speeder.

A Battle of Kashyyyk Droids Pack, it'd have 3 regular Battle Droids, 1 Super Battle Droid, and a Dwarf Spider Droid.

A Storm Trooper pack, with 2 Storm Troopers, 1 officer and 1 Jet Trooper, with a mini turbo laser.

A Clone Commanders pack, like the bounty hunter one with specific characters. It'd have Rex, Cody, Wolffe and Bly. 

Either that or a Finest of the 501st with Fives, Jesse, Kix, and Hardcase.

Going off the Bounty Hunter pack, I'd like a 'Heroes' pack for each faction, so to speak with characters you don't see often in sets or with different prints you don't see in sets.

For example, a 'Heroes of the Republic' pack would come with Anakin, Obi-Wan, Padme, and Ahsoka or Sheev or somebody like that.

Seperatists: Greivous, Dooku, Ventress, Kalani or Cad Bane or some other villian from the Clone Wars

Rebellion: Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie or Ackbar

Empire: Vader, Boba Fett, One of the Admarils Vader chokes, and Sidious

Resistance: Finn, Rey, Poe, Co Konnix (the person played by Carrie Fisher's daughter) or Rose

First Order: Kylo, Hux, Phasma, Snoke

So these are my ideas. They're probably bad ideas, not the smartest, not the best, but these are just personally battle packs I'd like to see. If you have better ones feel free to write a comment.",hot_subreddit,1,2019-03-12 16:32:32

They asked if I would reach out to some of the Lego community and see what sets collectors would want a acrylic display case for. Just to be clear I do not work for or get anything from the company. I just walked in the shop and asked about it last week.

It took weeks to package it all up but now the fun can start by putting them all back together again.

Odd that it doesn't look that much in pictures....

But we have a big, dedicated space just for my collection, and I can't wait to get things back up.

But which to go to first... i have a lot of love for the 6208 B Wing

Generally I feed this itch with small electronic/software projects. However this time, I felt the need for offline building. After some research (and a friend that recently built a Super Star Destroyer 10221) I decided to buy a couple cheaper Lego sets.

Picked up X-Wing 75218 from target on Saturday.

Within an hour of completing I purchased TIE Fighter 75211 delivered Sunday, and AT-ST Walker 75153 to be delivered today.

So where do I go from here? I think I would like to start getting into the UCS models next. However they are much more expensive.

What do you guys use for mounting? As someone without an existing stock of legos, I can't make cool mounts like I see on this subreddit.

Lastly, any other forums or youtube channels I should start looking into about Lego building?

Buying New Lego from people,0,8y973j,https://www.reddit.com/r/legostarwars/comments/8y973j/buying_new_lego_from_people/,8,1531397319.0,"Hey everyone, 

I'm currently buying a fair few lego sets from random people I met on an online website called Gumtree (the Aussie version of craigslist). I am, therefore, buying from people I don't know and have no affiliation with. I'm worried I may be scammed and would like to ask for those with experience here - how to ensure I get exactly what I'm paying for.

All the sets are new in their original boxes. How can I tell if they've been opened and the contents switched, then re-sealed? Is this even possible? Is a verbal contract enough to protect me?

This may sound like a bunch of overthinking, but I thought it would be worth bouncing off some people to ensure I do this correctly.

Would appreciate any helpful input.

Thanks!!!",controversial_subreddit,1,2018-07-12 07:08:39

Lego's bad sense of scale,3,5sv5gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/legostarwars/comments/5sv5gx/legos_bad_sense_of_scale/,11,1486584583.0,"I'm annoyed at the scale at which the Lego Group designs their sets. It's not exactly inconsistent. It's more just exponential. They try to make anything minifig scale, but when it reaches the max size they can sell, they shrink it down. This is why you end up with mere starfighters being the same width as star destroyers. I'm not saying they should make the bigger ships bigger, as they'd obviously become too big and expensive. I'm proposing that they make the smaller ships smaller than minifig scale. Not microscale, mind you, just smaller than currently. I'd still like minifigs to be able to fit, while not having the ship be full-size. And no, I'm not talking about microfighters either.

It gets worse the farther along you go, here's a handful that I can remember off hand; 

The starkiller hub is fraught with them.   A scavenger mission where you search for multiple helmet types, completed all the objectives and the mission isn't ending.  The mission to d'qar looking for hux's teddy bear, the farthest right revetment is transparent from the inside.  

the flying missions are awful because of the controls (either normal or reversed) are too twitchy.  the level maps where the 'waypoint' function doesn't operate consistently, and the icons in the map screen flicker back and forth between completed and open occasionally.

Various other missions in hubs not starting/ending properly.
And of course the occasional camera objective freakout(which has been a mild annoyance in most lego games)

Second, as the title says, i have two sets: 10030 (Imperial Star Destroyer) and 10019 (Rebel Blockade Runner AKA Tantive IV) that I am interested in selling.  Both were left in the basement by the previous owner of my house.  Both sets have the instruction books in good shape.  I only have the box for the Rebel ship and its not in great shape.  I also have no idea if all the pieces are there or not.  They are each in large plastic bins.  

So my questions are: 

1. Is it worth it to go through and inventory all the pieces or will it sell as-is?
2. If it is missing pieces, how hard is it to get replacement bricks?  Obviously the normal-ish shapes would be easy to find, but are their special bricks that are not available anymore on sets like these?
3. What's my approximate value for each?
4. Where's the best place to try to sell?

Its my first UCS model so im a little inexperienced when it comes to the weight/dimensions and display capability of this class of model.

First off: is there room in the engines to add LED's?

Secondly : i realise the top half is mostly panels, however is there enough of a structure underneath to possibly have this model leaning at a slight angle and not have all these panels slide off.

Following on, is this model capable of hanging from the ceiling or is it too heavy?

Lastly, is there a way to have the landing gear tucked inside?

Single dad. 2 kids. Huge Star Wars collection. But this just seems like its getting crazy. I dont know how kids or most families could ever afford this stuff nowadays. I just dropped $317 and I got 3 of the sets (Kylos ship, bomber and walker) and 2 of the characters I wanted (Chewbacca/Red Guard). Overall a decent haul. But then I see whats still left to get. The big 4-legged walker, BB-8 UCS and Reys character I still want. Not to mention the UCS Falcon. Thats like another $1100. FML

Disney is a bunch of money hungry a$$holes. I feel like the sets are marked up about 20-30% more than they really should be. But cant blame them after paying $4 billion for the franchise. The new stuff has been pretty cool overall.",controversial_subreddit,1,2017-09-01 12:28:10

The one from 2012 was only $54. Apparently the new Falcon set is gonna be $170 when the one from 2015 was $150.

Need inspiration!,2,8aikrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/legostarwars/comments/8aikrq/need_inspiration/,2,1523113215.0,"Now I have more free time available, I wanted to make a small Star Wars MOC like I used to do a few years ago before school stole most of my time. However, I'm having a bit of trouble getting a good idea of what to build.

While I'm able to build small speeders and such, I'm horrible at larger ships so I'm thinking of making something like a structure or terrain, at least something primarily static. As I don't have a lot of parts (or a super long attention span), I prefer to keep things small, but detailed; my older MOCs were mostly on a 32x32 baseplate but I'm currently thinking of using only a 16x16 baseplate.

Most of my minifigures are from the Galactic Civil War era so I'd like to do something with Imperials vs. Rebels. I bought some Battlefront battlepacks when they came out and I got the Bounty Hunter battlepack a year ago, but I've never used them in any MOC so I really want to use them sometime.

If you have any suggestions as to what to build, do please let me know! All ideas are appreciated :)",controversial_subreddit,1,2018-04-07 10:00:15

I do have the official set, and think it's neat, but the lack of a head was a missed opportunity, as many of you would likely agree.

The only other way I could see Lego completing the set is to release the walker's head in another (First Order) set, making it a side build of sorts.  Then, we could at least combine that side build with the main walker set, resulting in Lego not having to rerelease the entire thing.

Hi,
I would like your opinions about chinese (i guess) lego (lepin in particular). I have all original lego sets but now i'm looking to create a shelf with just clone army sets. The problem is that 90% of those sets aren't produced anymore and used ones still cost 400$-1000$. After losing another auction due to low funds (i'm a full time student) i started considering lego compatible one on aliexpress. They're affording and from the pics they looks totally like legos. Do you have only legit lego set or do you have some fake ones ? What do you think about getting them ?
Thank you all for reading :)

A few days back I posted asking about the value of my Naboo Starfighter Ultimate Collectors Series (UCS) 10026 set. After some suggestions from here and casual research I put it up for sale on ebay. I figured I'd repost here in the event anyone was looking for such a set:

http://www.ebay.com/itm/162483993048?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649

I have one bidder so far, and quickly looking at their account it looks like they buy and flip a lot of the Star Wars UCS sets. That is fine, but I would prefer it goes to a good home where it would be displayed rather than promptly re-listed for twice the price I sold it for. So if anyone wants to actually enjoy displaying this Naboo Starfighter do take a look before it is bought and likely re-listed.

Note: If this is against the rules I apologize, and the mods can remove the post. ",controversial_subreddit,1,2017-04-25 19:01:31

How to get new LEGO sets for 20% off!,0,99s19y,https://www.reddit.com/r/legostarwars/comments/99s19y/how_to_get_new_lego_sets_for_20_off/,7,1535064398.0,"I started collecting new to Star Wars Lego in October,  Over that time I acquired all but two UCS starships/fighters/vehicles (I am not interested in the prequel starships) along with a few system sized sets.   Over that time I also learned how to Ebay properly to get the most value.   The end results of my system set purchases from the last two weeks are below:

Xwing: $61
AT Hauler: $75
Conveyex:  $62
Cloud rider bikes: $26
Snoke throne room $50
Five polybag minifigs (Mudtrooper Hansolo,  DJ, Kessel miner, R3M2, Scarriff stormtrooper:  $50
All the above numbers included shipping.

Based on MSRP, I saved over 20% for these sets that were just released.  Patience is the key.  Don't jump to buy the sets at full retail when they first come out.  Better deals than what I got could be available as you monitor the Ebay platform. 

UCS sets are a different story however, as the iconic models always appreciate at a much faster rate.  By example I bought a sealed Imperial Shuttle in November 2017 for $450.  Even now that it is opened and built and on a shelf, it sells for $520.

Just thought I'd share.

They're getting to the point where the pricing is too much for figs who really aren't massable. Why can't we go back to cheaper infantry packs for army building?

Smaller astromech minifigures?,4,7xjtsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/legostarwars/comments/7xjtsu/smaller_astromech_minifigures/,2,1518630549.0,"Lego has been using the same basic astromech design for years now. Much like the Droideka minifigure-scale builds, they're oversized relative to the humanoid minifigs, and this causes further issues with how they fit in starfighter sets. They usually have to be turned sideways because of the lateral width across the legs.

Now that sequel-era ships have started coming with BB8 or similarly-sized droids, and now that some classic minifigs like Darth Vader have been redesigned to enhance realism, is it likely that we'll get a new kind of astromech minifig with a proportionally small footprint?

Quick fix for X-wing Rubber band problems,3,8gnp56,https://www.reddit.com/r/legostarwars/comments/8gnp56/quick_fix_for_xwing_rubber_band_problems/,4,1525321330.0,"This is probably repost material for the long-timers here, but:

I had a 75149 displayed on a shelf and after less than a year its lower wings were noticeably sagging just from the constant tension of gravity fatiguing the rubber, plus they rattled when ""swooshing"" in cruise mode.  I needed a design fix and especially didn't want it happening with the 75102 I was gifted this year. I know there are rubber band-free mods out there, but not wanting to spare the time & extra parts(?) for a partial rebuild, I just tried ordering an extra pair of the blue bands from Bricklink so there are 3 on each side. Cheap, quick & easy, and it seems to work well so far; the action is a bit stiffer but still works fine and there's no sag or rattle at all. Anyone else who's tried this, please let me know how your built x-wings are holding up over time.

Gotta say also I'm really disappointed in Lego's build for these, esp. since these are kinda high-end/desirable vehicle sets. All the more so, really, since it's such an easy fix (just 2 more pieces!) vs. redesigning the wing mechanism. Hard to justify paying the licensed brand premium for such a janky rattletrap design, but gladly there's more than one way to work it out.

TL;DR: The x-wings are WAY better with 3 rubber bands on each side.",controversial_subreddit,1,2018-05-02 23:22:10

I went online and all I can find are forums discussing said rumors but nothing concrete yet. But apparently the leaked Super Battledroid and Clone Trooper on AT-RT are just straight up canned and will never see the light of day.

GAHHH! I'll be so bummed if this turns out to be true. I'm 28 and the buildable figures line is actually one of my favorite line in recent years, granted I only bought the armored/helmeted figures because the humanoids look...frumpy...

Lego Death Star Story,5,8qk4uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/legostarwars/comments/8qk4uv/lego_death_star_story/,0,1528819406.0,"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

The Death Star was constructed in my father's abode in the galaxy of Houstana back in 2016. It was the emperor's prized possession and proudly displayed for the entire galaxy to revere. That was until the dark times. The filthy rebellion.

in late 2017, whispers of a 2-year exodus from Houstana arose. The emperor was not too happy to hear his fully operational station would be going into the unknown regions and formulated a plan to move the station to Chi-Cag, with a winter almost as fierce as Hoth, to create a new capital. Little did he know, rebel intelligence caught wind of his plans and so their counter-attack flew into motion.

The rebels had been systematically chased down by the Emperor and his Dark Lord(s) of the Sith, and had actually set-up a base in Chi-Cag. The Death Star in such close proximity would not be condoned. Not at all. 

On Memorial Day, the Rebels paid their respects to their fallen comrades of the past. They also sent every spare ship in their fleet - custom X-wings, a classic 2000 A-wing, the 2000 Millennium Falcon, a U-Wing, and even a rusted Naboo starfighter to take on the Death Star. There were casualties on both sides - for the Imperials: a Blue/black 2000 Tie-Fighter, Tie Interceptor, even a 2000 Slave I, all failed to defend the Death Star. The damage was nearly catastrophic, with each level of the Death Star and each quartile of each level, all disbanded. In fact, only the U-wing and Millennium Falcon have been rebuilt - until last night...
 
The Emperor survived the destruction. Somehow. He ordered his top engineers to rebuild the Death Star as quickly as possible. Over the course of a few days in early June, the process went as smoothly as one could imagine. Each section was cordoned off in its own airlock gravity seals. The lower level was completed in under an hour. The middle section twice as long. The detention block had a few missing pieces, but these later re-surfaced during the re-construction of the emperor's throne room. 

Finally, we were left with 5 straggler pieces. With 2 clear vacancies in the (almost) finished built. Did they get lost during the move? ""No, they couldn't have,"" replied the Master Builder. 

In the detection block, there was a 1x3 black piece missing, but a 1x2 black piece and 1x1 triangular black piece left. These had to be swapped incorrectly during the re-build. After much deliberation, the correct structure was created with 2 extra pieces and 1 vacancy eliminated. 3 extras and 1 vacancy left.

One of the extras was identified to be in the yellow crane section, and was quickly replaced. 2 extras, 1 vacancy.

The second to last extra was a 2x3 grey block. After going through the Death Star plans for what seemed like an hour (but was really 11 minutes), it was identified that it went in between the floor for the Tie-fighter hangar. How the Master Builder figured this out, the other engineers had no clue...

One vacancy, one extra, implying that the missing piece was incorrectly put somewhere that should have been where the extra went. Missing: 1x2 grey block, extra: 2x2 inverted triangular piece (not sure the correct term). 

Eureka! The bottom part of the structure (where Luke and Leia swing from one end to the other), had a doorway that needed the 2x2 triangular piece at the top left. Problem was, the whole upper 2 levels rested on this foundation and needed to be carefully removed to replace it. Alas, it was 12:30 AM and the Master Builder had work the next day. F*** it. Let's ride.

During this exact moment, the little band of Rebels struck once more. Absolute mayhem. All the hard work was lost. The bottom structure was crumbling, the top was fine, but it seemed impossible that the bottom would be able to be repaired while the top part was held suspended by another. It was the most challenging build ever - not because of the technical challenges, but because the job had been effectively completed, only to come roaring back with a myriad string of new fixes needed.

But guess what, Rebels? I'm working from home today. Oh, I'm afraid the Death Star will be quite operational when your (girl)friend arrives!",controversial_subreddit,1,2018-06-12 11:03:26

She got older and out them back in the plastic bins they were in. The biggest mistake came when she tossed all the instructions away for her and my Lego grrr.

No biggie, I can find them online.

No this is where the trouble starts. I have rebuilt a few of them and started working on set #7184 Trade Federation MTT. The instructions all say that it should have 4 earth orange #4143675 2x6 brick (I have none of these) and 6 earth orange #4116672 1x6 brick.

Now the strange part is the instructions show all 4 of the 2x6 bircks being used and only two of the 1x6 bricks being used. 

Also the instructions show 13 brick yellow #4114324 1x8 plate in the build but only uses 11?

So any help would be awesome!

The Story

So I‚Äôve started collecting Lego Star Wars for just over a year now. I have always loved the design of the Starfighters and really digged the opening scene of Episode III. So I fantasized many ‚Äòa times about having the red and yellow fighter adorning my Lego shelf‚Ä¶.but always figured I was too late to actually own them since I had missed the release of the yellow 75038 about half a year. Nowadays, it is nowhere to be found (except for excessive amounts of cash). The red version wasn‚Äôt even made.


But Then

‚Ä¶came the release of Obi Wan‚Äôs sweet, sweet ride, 75135! INSTANT BUY of course, and now 50% of my dream setup was suddenly realized. This sparked a renewed faith within me and I scoured the second hand lego websites for that yellow fighter. Set 75038 was, indeed, still only available for the price of a Star Destroyer, so that was a no-go. I then came across a ‚Äòsomewhat opened‚Äô set 7256 (the boxed was ripped open, but the bags were still intact). I figured; yellow fighter, SCORE! My enthusiasm was a bit curbed, when collecting the actual box, I noticed that this set included just a head of our good ol‚Äô friend R2‚Ä¶they just popped his head onto the wing. No body parts! Blegh. But hey, the build itself should be a lot of fun right‚Ä¶? 


The Disillusion

A couple of days later I decided to put together the darn thing. Having already built 75135, I could not really rejoice over this set (7256). Ok, it had a complementary Vulture Droid. Ok, it was yellow. And a Starfighter. But the overall build quality and looks were just‚Ä¶.not ok. It is more of a display model (which for me, is fine as I will not be ‚Äòhandling‚Äô it), but it feels so flimsy that I was scared it would break if I looked at it for more than three consecutive seconds. It also looked a lot smaller than Obi Wan‚Äôs ride. But hey, they were finally together. Case closed. Well, not really.


The Plan, the Challenge

Set 7256 remained in my mind during the next couple of days. It just wasn‚Äôt up to par with it‚Äôs counterpart. Something had to be done. I then browsed across the rest of my Lego Star Wars shelf, to find something quite similar to the 7256‚Ä¶set 7669. I already owned set 7669 al long time as it was one of the first sets I got after my dark years, but besides not looking all to well, it is also a ‚ÄòRebels‚Äô set, which was not what I ended up collecting. Finally it hit me: I could try to rob parts of 7669 to upgrade my 7256 to something more sturdy! Something bigger! Something more like 75038! I have a lot of other bricks lying around, but I decided there and then that this build would have to done using ONLY bricks from either set 7256 or 7669. It would enable me to fit in a real, whole R2D2 and update Ani‚Äôs hairpiece (because let‚Äôs face it, the 7256 hairpiece doesn‚Äôt quite cut it). I agreed with myself to only update the wing sections for now, to see where it would take me. 


The Result

About 2 hours later, the end result is here! I am really pleased how it turned out. Concessions were made in terms of symmetry and overall color use, but it feels really sturdy and looks great besides Obi Wan‚Äôs 75135. Ideally, I would have made it one stud less in length, but I couldn‚Äôt get it to fit properly. 


The Pics

I am really eager to learn what you guys think! Any feedback, tips, or opinions really would be appreciated. Please let me know in the comments, hope you enjoy the [pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/141828760@N03/albums/72157666993933531)!",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-04-14 13:27:52

Edit: it's cool that you all get 100% complete sets and I know lego will ship me a block in a few days. Still sucks that building progress stops because that single piece is usually in the form of an axle block or something otherwise hard to sub/replace. 
I'm up to 4 sets this year and I just built 7 in the past two weeks so maybe that's why it seems a little too frequent for my liking.

A Problem I'd Like to Share...,5,43hlyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/legostarwars/comments/43hlyl/a_problem_id_like_to_share/,1,1454212768.0,"Years ago my brother and I played Lego Star Wars 2 on the PC.  We enjoyed the game and had a lot of fun but our progress was stopped before we could ever complete it on one particular level.  In the Battle of Endor, part of the level requires R2D2 to hover across a large gap to reach a platform and interact with a switch.  The gap is made so that R2 will have just barely enough time to reach the platform before falling.  All well and good, but the gap is at an odd angle.  Because we were playing on a keyboard, we could only have R2 fly in 8 set directions, while the perfect path to reach the platform was somewhere in between 2 of them.  R2 would have to fly against the wall, which sent him in the right direction but wasn't time efficient enough for him to make it across the gap, or he could rapidly switch between 2 directions that made it difficult to control him and also wouldn't give him enough time.  Thus, it was impossible for us to reach the platform and finishing the game was out of the question.  We later played The Complete Saga on the Wii and, with access to an analogue stick, had no problem with this level.  I'm not looking for a solution to this problem, as I said this was years ago and we later were able to beat it on the Wii anyways, but I'm extremely curious to know if anyone else has had this issue.  After extensive googling I could only find it mentioned in one comment on a very old walkthrough forum.",controversial_subreddit,1,2016-01-30 21:59:28

As far as aesthetics go, I want these to be showcases/conversation pieces alongside my home theatre setup; so the goal is subtle but elegant. 

My thought was to do the Y-Wing fighter, but hesitate because I don‚Äôt think the Y-Wing is as iconic to Star Wars as, say, the Red Five X-Wing fighter. However, the Red Five has been out of stock for a while and prices will steadily rise on it so I figure I‚Äôd better pull the trigger sooner than later. 

What do you guys think? Should I put the Snowspeeder or Y-Wing opposite the Slave 1, or go back and find a Red Five X-Wing (or other UCS set you can think of) instead? 

Edit: I bought the Red Five X-Wing Fighter. ",controversial_subreddit,1,2018-07-15 22:10:44

[A video of the truck in action](https://reddit.com/link/ahlxnp/video/hd0hom5cndb21/player)

We have also submitted the truck as a LEGO Ideas project.¬† If you like the model we'd be grateful for your support.¬† You can see our Ideas page and support the project at [https://ideas.lego.com/projects/7d7f4e15-55e7-44c4-bb30-3a66b9cc0598](https://ideas.lego.com/projects/7d7f4e15-55e7-44c4-bb30-3a66b9cc0598).

More images and explanations of the truck functions are below.

[An image of the whole project](https://i.redd.it/kq9n57jpmdb21.png)

The bin arm is operated by a knob and reaches out and grabs and dumps standard LEGO dust bins with a plate on the bottom.¬†

[A top view of the bin arm grabbing a trash bin](https://i.redd.it/p1mcn5lsmdb21.png)

[The bin arm dumping a garbage can](https://i.redd.it/yws2vbmvmdb21.png)

There is also a ram in the hopper that is operated by a second knob.¬† It pushes the trash into the dumper:

[The ram in action](https://i.redd.it/75goyhaxmdb21.png)

The inside of the dumper is smooth to allow the trash to dump out:

[A view of the back of the truck](https://i.redd.it/9q2vu932ndb21.png)

We're interested to get feedback on the build.¬† Getting the bin arm to smoothly and reliably dump trash and integrating that and the¬†ram into a compact build¬†was definitely one of the big challenges.¬† The truck with some ""waste"" bricks is about 450 pieces.¬†¬†This design was created and refined with bricks on hand over the course of more than a year and at least a dozen different design iterations. ¬†We then created a model in LEGO Digital Designer and used digital renders to visualize different colors.¬†

The custom printed tiles¬†were created digitally using LDPatternCreator, using¬†Bricklink's Studio tool¬†and Blender with some custom lighting for the final digital renders and some animations.¬† The video is partly digital rendering and partly live filming.¬† For creating actual custom printed bricks, we made color laser prints of the designs, covered them with scotch tape and then gently washed the paper off using water, leaving enough stickiness on the tape to stick to the bricks.¬† This was quick and easy and the tiles were durable enough to play/build with, so that worked very well for our purposes.

The cab holds a minifig comfortably, and there is a a hand rail and ladder for another minfig to ride along.¬† There are clips to hold tools for cleaning up as well.

&#x200B;

Congratulations to all of the Mechs who survived the play-in round. You can see the results here and preview this round [here](https://www.bracketsninja.com/bracket/beb340e8-bae1-428e-9ca0-83fcfbfdc633).

&#x200B;

***Due to Reddit's habit of hiding negatively scored posts, please take the time to look at all of the matchups, even the hidden ones. The only comments in this post are the mech matchups. And please forgive me as we're all learning how to do this type of contest the right way. Cheers.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*How to vote*: Every comment is a match-up. There will be two mechs to vote for. If you want to vote for the first mech, the one on the left, then *UPvote* the comment. However, if you want to vote for the second mech, the one on the right, then *DOWNvote* the comment.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/iwrb1q87yjq21.png

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The mech with the largest number will move on to the next round. The thread will be in contest mode, so the order may not follow the one on the bracket, but the match-ups will be the same. You will also not see the vote totals, so vote for whichever one you like.

&#x200B;

***Voting will run through Tuesday, April 9th.***

&#x200B;

Again, thank you to everyone participating.

The head and helmet is the same as the ones from Infinity War, and the body and legs are the same generic suit as all the other heroes in endgame. So if you have infinity war Iron Man and buy the Hall of Armor, you will have two copies of the same figure. Get one other cheap endgame set and you can rip the head from the spare Mk 50 and put it on a torso from someone else. 

sh575 on bricklink - will show the parts list and all the sets each came out in.

I doubt the poly will be that expensive, but if I can get away without buying it then that works better for me. Plus I dont feel like running to every walmart in my area to hunt it up only to find out a scalper went in and bought them all up.

Thank you for your feedback. 


Since there was so much negative feedback, I just wanted to let everyone know that I haven't, nor will I,  purchased and returned any legos. 

I came up with this idea a couple weeks ago, because my girlfriend doesn't see the value in legos and hates when I ""waste money"" on large sets.

It turned into a lot of drama (overselling kits, asking for more money, multiple delays, factory fire) and now I'm trying to resolve a refund through PayPal. My full story and screenshots are in the Imgur album below.

They‚Äôre for a project of building some custom intermodal train cars, and since this size is flexible i thought i would use it as scale.

Tron Lightbike 'hubcaps' defect. Lego can't send a good replacement,8,b9rzdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/b9rzdc/tron_lightbike_hubcaps_defect_lego_cant_send_a/,7,1554475084.0,"[Here is the bike as built from the parts included with the original set](https://i.redd.it/1e5h3l14jgq21.jpg)

Got this set and excitedly built it. One of the orange hubcaps was not like the other three in the kit, it had a hole straight through and obviously no lego logo on the 'nub' (whatever it is called). No problem, annoying but no problem, I contacted Lego and they promptly sent me a replacement. Two weeks later it arrives and the replacement part has the SAME problem. That is very strange I think...I check online and see that yes indeed I am not crazy, the part is supposed to have no hole all the way through the center. So I contact Lego again, and again they promptly send a replacement part. They agree that this is very strange. Wait another couple of weeks and get the replacement part in the mail. It ALSO has the SAME defect. At this point I am going to request ANOTHER replacement, but fear whatever bin they are pulling parts from will have the same defect again. All the blue 'hubcaps' are complete and have the logo on the 'nub' as do three of the original orange hubcaps. This set wasn't cheap, and I want it to be complete with correct parts.... wish me luck!

The 75159 UCS Death Star set was 499.99 before tax, so I think I'm fine with that. I have opened the brown cardboard box it comes in, but the actual set itself is unopened and sealed, no damages to box. I think I'm covered for a full return, but I wanted to ask the question here for Lego experts to confirm this or not.

&#x200B;

Also, it came with a freebie gift for a purchase of $70+. Will they ask me to return this gift as well? I'm prepared to if they ask, this isn't a scam to get the freebie gift on my end, I just don't want the UCS Death Star anymore.

Easter Lego catalog misprint?,9,b9ccsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/b9ccsw/easter_lego_catalog_misprint/,9,1554382514.0,"My kids got their Easter Lego catalog yesterday and were gracious enough to allow me to dive into every picture looking at the new sets. I don't see the Easter one online yet (and by the way, when did Easter start getting its own Lego catalog?).


I was looking at a few of the Star Wars sets, especially the ones that I imagine come from episode 9. I found them [here]
(https://shop.lego.com/en-US/category/star-wars). 

**Major Vonreg's TIE Fighter (75240)**. That red TIE Fighter looks awesome -- It looks like a [TIE Interceptor](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/TIE/IN_interceptor) (first seen in Return of the Jedi) with red trim, which is awesome. My wife will probably want that one. The name is cool, it's another personal fighter with personalized paint (like Poe's X-Wing), no need to say it's a TIE Interceptor, because it's so obvious that's what it is -- sweeping angled ""wings"" with notches out of the centers for the pilot's visibility make it very clear.

**Black Ace TIE Interceptor (75242)**. Okay, this one doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's ""clearly"" a Jedi Starfighter that's been modified. And the whole ""TIE"" thing means ""Twin Ion Engines"", and that thing has either one (at the back of the cockpit) or three (also at the wingtips). If it weren't for being released at the same time as the red TIE Interceptor, I could just call this a continuity problem, renaming, or whatever. But because this vehicle is clearly not a TIE Interceptor, and it's released at the same time as a TIE Interceptor with a different name... Not that I'd call this thing Major Vonreg's TIE Fighter, so maybe the names aren't really messed up so much as this one got the wrong one?

Is this a misprint? Not just in the catalog, but online too?",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-04 07:55:14

Zilch. And I couldn't remember the name of it either, which made it especially hard to locate any information about it. So it was this lego stopmotion thing, and the tagline was ""A Show About Everything"". I don't think that was the actual name of the show, though. There were two protagonists, both male, and there were both lego and human versions of them. I remember blowing up test dummies, a baby with a massive head and psychic powers, a massive freezer where they went to find ice cream, killing the animator, being pranked by God after pranking him, and many other strange scenarios. Does this ring any bells for anyone? Does anyone know where I can find this again and if not, why?

Speaking from the heart: Do you think TLG has been getting out of touch with its customers?,4,b91s4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/b91s4f/speaking_from_the_heart_do_you_think_tlg_has_been/,16,1554316464.0," [https://www.thebrickfan.com/is-lego-disconnected-from-its-fans/#respond](https://www.thebrickfan.com/is-lego-disconnected-from-its-fans/#respond) 

Do you wonder if TLG is getting disconnected from the fans? I have to admit, I am having grievances.

My response to the article linked is:

"" The three main series I'm into are Castle, DC Comics, and Star Wars. Castle is defunct, DC Comics is just Batman with a random hero or villain from outside the Gotham-verse tacked on to make the set unique in an irritating way, and Star Wars suffers from intense repetitiveness and now rather high prices compared to set sizes (though that may be more Disney's fault than TLG). If this keeps up, I may go into a Dark Age.""

&#x200B;

TLG has been neglecting its classic series (City excepted) for years now. Meanwhile LEGO DC Comics might as well be LEGO Batman and friends. In Star Wars, we keep getting the same vehicles over and over while others are just ignored completely.",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-03 13:34:24

Sorry if I may bother you but I really need some helps on this
I‚Äôm design student and currently have to do some researches about lego in terms of its design and story. I have recently found this book called ‚ÄúThe LEGO book‚Äù by Daniel Lipkowitz with a rather wide range of knowledge about lego. However I couldn‚Äôt find any ebook version that I could buy. So if you know some sources, please please help me. Or in case you know any academic sources about this topic that I can get online, can you please send me?
Oh, the reason why I find online sources only is that I live in Vietnam and there‚Äôs no hard-copy version of the book here and it takes to long for the book to ship here if I buy one.

If you are making substitutions/changes, here is what I recommend.

* Bar 1 x 4 x 2 can be left out if you don't want the hand rail or you are going to stack them
* Brick, Modified 1 x 2 with Handle on End - Bar Flush with Edge of Handle in sand blue can be subbed out for light bluish-gray because that is a cheaper part
* Slope 18 2 x 1 x 2/3 with 4 Slots in metallic silver can be swapped out for either light bley or dark bley, your choice, and it would be cheaper.

Also, in case you are wondering, if you pull these in as tight as possible, 9 of the bays makes a half circle so 18 bays would make a full circle. What I am going to do is to make 3 levels of half circles for a total of 27 bays.

I hope you find this useful.",hot_subreddit,1,2019-04-01 17:46:18

Any speculation or educated guesses are welcome.  Fell in love with this theme recently and can't wait to see what they'll release next. 

 If I had to take a guess on what will come out next, these would be it:

* Acura NSX street or GT3 version
* Some sort of Lambo, most likely a Huracan or Countach
* Bentley Continental GT3
* Audi Quattro
* Shelby Cobra
* Ford Focus Gymkhana (assuming could get licensing)
* Honda Civic Type R
* Aston Martin, either  DB11, Vantage or Vulcan.  (Probably my top pick of which new manufacturer will join the SC family)
* NHRA top fuel dragster

I'm thinking of posting instructions for Speed Buggy in the updates for this LEGO project, but I doubt it'll do much good if you just want to make one for yourself.  There's a few parts used to make this model that are uncommon and currently cost about $8/piece on Bricklink. :(  I haven't found any ideal workarounds for those parts, yet.

You never know, though...when I was first trying to make this model years ago, the yellow wheels were hard for me to find.  I had to resort to an overseas supplier.  But now...the yellow wheels are seemingly more plentiful.  That, or I confused the numbers and parts...sometimes there are close alternates for parts where one version is rare, and the other version can be found easily everywhere.

Help me persuade Lego to feature at least one female StarWars character in an affordable small box set.,0,3vw54c,https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/3vw54c/help_me_persuade_lego_to_feature_at_least_one/,44,1449551846.0,"My 5yr old daughter is a HUGE Star Wars fan. As a father who is equally obsessed with StarWars, we are both very excited about the new line of lego coming out with The Force Awakes... However...

There is not one female character available in a small box set, but plenty of male characters (unless of course the Empire have equal employment opportunities for Storm Troopers and the lady faces are hidden underneath the helmets.)

I'd love to be able to afford both the Leia and Rey box sets, but it's pretty steep considering Leia is only currently available with the Millennium Falcon and Rey only comes with her speeder (or Falcon).

Ebay does have individual figures, but price and postage means it's not very cost effective.

I'd be grateful if you could lend your voice to this thread and maybe somebody at Lego HQ might oblige.

Thanks 

EDIT - Thanks for the buying tips. Still would like to see more Female Star Wars Characters at the same entry point as the rest of the lead male characters, but at least there are these coming out next year:http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Star-Wars/subtheme-MicroFighters/year-2016

So I didn't, I didn't even pick up whatever I could have to get the spaceslug and FO Trooper Polybag. I left the mall with no Lego for the first May 4th in 3 years. This set is beyond brutal and with the rest of the weak showings lately have me thinking the Golden age of SW sets is coming to an end. There have been some pretty bad sets lately with high price tags and the smaller sets have been either recycled or scenes that have been scaled down to much to accommodate piece counts. The Carbon Freezing Chamber was a good opportunity for a decent sized set with great minifigs and it ended up being pretty weak. Max Kanata's could have been so much better and Kylo Ren's shuttle while cool is not remotely accurate in colour or function. I never even used to look at the boxes, if it had the SW logo I just bought it. Now, I'm so picky. I only buy about 60-70% of the sets released every year, I buy a lot of retired sets and I've been buying other themes and Modulars lately.

Punished the boy for no reason,0,20lb7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/20lb7l/punished_the_boy_for_no_reason/,29,1395015774.0,"I have two boys.  1 year old and 4 year old.  The 1 year old does 1 year old things like eat EVERYTHING.  My 4 year old's rule is that EVERY Lego brick has to be off of the floor and put away when he's awake.

I bought him two sets a few weeks back.  They were It was a Juniors construction sets (10666 and 10667).  The first day, he lost 2 pieces from the backhoe, both REALLY small.  Since a toddler has HUGE health concerns (silly things like death and all that), this was a big deal.

His punishment?  No touching the Lego bin for 1 week (the following Saturday).  None.  At all.  Unless of course, he found those two missing pieces.

In the interim, I ordered the missing pieces from Lego.  They still have not arrived, but that's another whine.  I'd planned on finding a way of using them to teach him a lesson.

Today, his cousins were over and they got his Lego bin out.  That second set?  The one with the wrecking ball?  They opened it up and found the two missing pieces.

We punished the boy for nothing...  He was exactly as responsible with them as we'd demanded.

I guess we have to make this up to him, somehow.  Sounds like a trip to the Lego store!  PURELY for the boy's enjoyment, of course.

Just thought the parents among us would get a kick out of it.",controversial_subreddit,1,2014-03-16 19:22:54
Giving up on collecting Lego,0,wr98q,https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/wr98q/giving_up_on_collecting_lego/,16,1342616078.0,"About six months ago, I sold my ~57 Lego Star Wars sets, ranging from 1999 to 2010. The descision to do so, however, was made 1¬Ω years prior to this. And it was the best decision I have ever made, concerning Legos.

I have played with Legos all my life along with my siblings, both the old knights/castle-stuff, the western, lego Belville, and we even still have the manuals for some old Lego System sets. Us being Danish, it was also very natural for parents to buy Legos, and it was present in just about every kindergarten or likewise.

I have always been an avid Star Wars-fan, so when the two combined, my collection was started. Of course, in the beginning, it was only as birthday and christmas-presents, but most of my allowance also went to this, and as I got older, practically all of my money went to Legos or clothes.

But then, in 2005, Star Wars ended. I thought, sad, but hey, maybe then I could get the older sets I didn't get back then. Or maybe even the biggest Lego set to date, the 5000 brick Millennium Falcon.

Alas, in 2008, The Clone Wars 3D came in theaters and the Lego Star Wars franchise was renewed. I continued buying for around two years, but the constant pressure of having to collect them all got to me. It was too much.

When I stopped collection, I had 15 unopened sets. Sets I had never gotten around to build.

My love of Legos and Star Wars separately is still as strong, but together, it is going downhill. The new sets, as a general trend in Lego, is too advance, way too many custom pieces, new colours, and even new editions of older Star Wars sets (Slave II, Jabbas Palace, of which I had both of the older ones).

When I made the decision to sell, I also made the decision to keep my Mini-sets (and also my Lego Space Discovery-series sets of which I am only missing the shuttle). I had all of the ones released in Denmark (some sets we don't get, despite being the home of the company), and for me, they represent the true form of Lego - minimalistic, simple pieces, but you can still se what it is meant to be.

For the same reason, I am also in love with the new Lego Star Wars Planets. It combines true Lego with my love of planetary physics/geology, which is also my field of study.

I chose to sell it all to one buyer, a young owner of a toy store, for what amounts to 1500$. It is a lot less than the whole lot is worth on bricklist, especially because the older sets like Jabbas Palace has increased in value. But this way, all of it was gone in one instant. Going to the post-office with Lego every so often was really not something I wanted to bother with.


I have never regretted selling my Lego.

Disney Minifigure Rant,0,4hhb54,https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/4hhb54/disney_minifigure_rant/,30,1462196680.0,"So I'm a huge Disney fan and was super excited for this series to come out. I've been seeing users post their Disney minifigures that they got early and my excitement only grew. At this point I haven't decided whether I'd buy a whole box, a few blind bags then bricklink the rest, or brinklink an entire set. Besides the Simpsons series, this is the only other one where I'd want a complete set.  
  
 I go the Lego website yesterday to order and they're already sold out. I go over to brinklink and see some for sale. One seller had them all and were selling them at $5.75 each. I considered my options and my wallet and decide I could stomache the 150% increase for a few characters. I go back to web site and in the 5 minutes I was away the seller increased his prices up to $7-$8. Now I don't blame the seller as he's pricing them as the other sellers are, but damn. Couldn't pull the trigger.  
  
I know Disney is extremely popular, and happy that with this series doing well, we may get the Cinderella castle, but shoot, I just want some Disney minifigs at a reasonable price and I can see myself having a hard time getting some because of the speculative after market.

"Commenting that MOC construction is ""illegal"" is like commenting that race cars drive at illegal speeds.",0,7t7ro5,https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/7t7ro5/commenting_that_moc_construction_is_illegal_is/,16,1517001566.0,"""Illegal"" really only applies to models that are planned to be official LEGO sets.  The term is a misuse of the word and was popularized by [Jamie Berard's brief to LEGO designers](http://bramlambrecht.com/tmp/jamieberard-brickstress-bf06.pdf).  ""Illegal"" construction comments could be applied towards Ideas proposals, but otherwise, nah, not for MOCs; LEGO hobbyists are limited only by their own choices and imagination.

Pretending to be a LEGO designer can be fun, so sure, hobbyists may want to avoid ""illegal"" or NASAL (Not Acceptable Stress Allowance Level) connections and insist their own models meet some personal standard of robustness, but in my opinion, it's pedantic and inaccurate to comment that connections used in a MOC are ""illegal"".",controversial_subreddit,1,2018-01-26 15:19:26

That money's been completely ignored for years, and recently he's thought of investing again into some sort of profitable investment._


He's not looking for any immediate profit, maybe just a little in a few years time.


**He's going to invest ¬£50~ every month into Lego Sets.**


So:


A) Is this a good idea? He's not super intrigued on making a quick profit


B) Any tips on how to maximise profit/make everything easier?


_He's not too worried about making a huge profit within a month, he'll be patient, wait at least a couple of years. Even if it isn't immediately successful, or not whatsoever, this wasn't money he was every planning on using anyway, so it won't be a huge loss either._

Source: Canada MST

EDIT: Sounds like the site is crashing for people in EST at least.. might just be due to traffic in EU 

EDIT2: Found [This](https://twitter.com/LEGO_Group/status/908059205831098370). Going to bed till 5am MST

EDIT3: So this is what 5am feels like... I hate it, don't let me down LEGO! Still no update on the CAN site

EDIT4: And 5:30am EST passes as well.. guess I'm spending the sunrise F5'ing instead of napping :(

EDIT5: Available to put one on backorder now..

EDIT6: Nvm, kicked me out?? But buy limit lowered to 1 per customer

EDIT7: Going back and forth between adding to cart and getting booted out of checkout.. it appears to be released but their servers are apparently made of lego.. It was signing me out so I cleared cookies to try to fix it and now can't sign back in.. RIP

EDIT8: Lmao.. LEGO Shop down for maintenance?

EDIT9: I finally got into paypal checkout! Looks like it might finally be working..

FINAL EDIT: After F5'ing the page from 5am to 6:40am, adding the MF to my cart and then fucking around in and out of checkout/login until 7:40am, the MF in my cart finally changed from order to backorder.. thanks LEGO, I give up.

The main one is that it's horribly disproportional to other sets. It's bigger than a star destroyer! How tf do I display a Falcon next to a First Order destroyer when the Falcon is like twice the size? It's like the same size as the super destroyer, if the pictures do it any justice. This is why I'll stick to the smaller, TFA Falcon. It's still absurdly large when held up next to a destroyer, but it doesn't dwarf it.

Seriously though I bet it is driving some folks crazy, especially ones that don't care for Star Wars, or the MF specifically.

I do like the MF, and plan to get then new UCS if I can, but I really love the Slave 1 and the Imperial Shuttle a little more just because I like their shapes better and they display very nicely. 

Non-UCS I love the smaller shuttle for the same reason, and the Jawa transport because it has so many ""play"" features.  AT-AT's are always fun too and great for display on a work desk if you are able to get away with that.

If you do like Star Wars Lego, what is your fav set, UCS or not?

* 75152 - This looks like a small set. ~30 - 40$

* 75153 - This is most likely a midesize set. ~50 - 100$

* 75154 - Looks like a big set. Cardboard proportions remind my of the Ewok Village or UCS Slave 1. ~150$ - 250$

* 75155 - Looks like a big set. Cardboard proportions remind my of the Ewok Village or UCS Slave 1. ~150$ - 250$

* 75156 - Looks really really big. Like UCS big. Compared to the other two large sets almost like UCS Falcon big. Could it really be? ~250$ and up

* 75119 - Propably an Action Figure. ~20$

* 75120 - Propably an Action Figure. ~20$

* 75121 - Propably an Action Figure. ~20$

As the designer of the UCS Slave 1 stated, there will be atleast one set with the 95188 Brick in dark blue. 

I am very excited for the big box on the left. I should start saving just in case we get a second minifig scale UCS Falcon. All those bricklinking or already owning a Falcon sure will not be pleased, but sure I would be.

Letter sent to Lego about rereleasing old sets.,2,5zluxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/5zluxk/letter_sent_to_lego_about_rereleasing_old_sets/,27,1489608936.0,"Hi Lego Lady / Lego Gentleman,

I think you should bring out a CLASSIC LEGO line. In this line you release fan favourite sets from years ago. I am thinking of the 1980 Space Lego Sets (918 & 928 space ships in particular), but I am sure other Adult fans would have their own ideas. I have talked about this idea in LEGO forums and have always received many positive replies from people all wanting the opportunity to (1) build these sets again from their childhood and (2) give them to their own kids, passing on something special to someone special. I know the demand would be immense. 

You have an Ultimate Collection Edition line for big sets for Adult fans, so such a Classic Lego Line would fit right in here. You could even organise a world wide ballet to see which sets get reissued, possibly even doing it country by country. What do you think ?

Personally I think this is a winner of an idea, even if I do say so myself. :) 

ps. I can remember receiving the 928 (928-1: Space Cruiser And Moonbase) for one Christmas, the box being almost as big as me. Feeling just like a kid used to small pizzas being handed a King Sized one. And I know if I was able to buy this set, and others from around that time, well, it would be most awesome.

pps. You could even duplicate the original packaging for an added bit of wowness. Thank you for your time.

--------------------

If this gets Lego to realise how wonderful and financially wowie it would be to re-release the Classic Space line, and possibly others then: **you're welcome internet and yes I do rock. :) **",controversial_subreddit,1,2017-03-15 15:15:36

A few months ago I got into a discussion with someone who absolutely denied that the minifigure legs/hips are angled in the production process.  
While it's possible that they get straightened out during the shipping process due to weight of other pieces, Beyond the Brick released a video today and right here you can see how the legs are in fact angled on the mold while getting their prints applied, which is the last step before being put into their designated sets..  
After the print is applied, they roll onto the conveyor belt, with the signature angle that I was talking about.

My theory is that Lego could possibly release a Lego Star Wars Rebels video game based on the TV show. My reasoning for this is in 2011 they released Lego Star Wars III the clone wars and that was based of the movie and season 1&2 of the show. So do any of you think this is a possible game?

Resealed boxes with stolen figures,0,3epp8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/3epp8i/resealed_boxes_with_stolen_figures/,17,1437955707.0,"I just want to say that to anyone who has purposely stolen lego. Why? Why would you do something so petty. I'm not talking those guys who steal thousands worth, I mean the people who steal a handful of figures. Why? It's a toy. 

I went to Walmart for shipping supplies and saw the Javelin on sale to $49.00. I was stoked because I was planing on buying it from amazon for $60. So hey $11.00 saved. However, when I picked it up it sloshed around inside. I bought it, took to the customer service counter to open and check. Yep, some had stolen the figs. wow. 

I get lego is expensive. But the fact of the matter is it's still a toy people. In addition, not only did that person steal figures, they also almost ripped me off, duping me into buying the husk of their looted prey.

No one NEEDS lego. I repeat YOU DO NOT NEED LEGO. IT IS A TOY. If you can't afford it do not get it. If you can, buy it. If you can afford it, but don't want to shell out $70 - bricklink or trade.

Seriously I know this is not a new thing, but it just amazes me to see for myself how horrible people can be over a toy. A TOY! This isn't a loaf of bread to feed your starving family. There is no justification for this. 

TL:DR If you steal lego, I pity your construed mentality that led you to doing such a shallow act of destructive narcissism.

Even if you don't think these are outright lies (they don't go anywhere near as far as Nintendo's ""emulators are illegal""), they at least heavily mislead. The brochure also claims (despite being written in 2011) that the brick is still a trademark of Lego, as well as falsely implying that an advertisment for HD television is trademark infringement.",controversial_subreddit,1,2017-05-26 08:20:28

Most of 'my' lego sits in a closet and is rarely pulled out for building, while the 'kids' lego gets dumped in bins, rooted through, and have minifigures that get up to all kinds of shenanigans.
At the store a few nights ago I picked up two of the LEGO Disney minifigs, planning on adding them to 'my' hidden collection. After opening the minifigures (Alice, and the Genie) I realized that the 5 year old would have a blast with them, so the next day they were off sleeping in the LEGO Friend's bakery, having baths, and having a much better time being played with than if they sat in a box or on a shelf for years.
I feel I am finally realizing that as much as LEGO can be collectible, it is most of all about being fun.
Hopefully this can inspire a few other AFOLs to relax a bit and let the LEGO be fun for all ages again.",top_subreddit,1,2016-06-09 16:05:14

This app will allow users to photograph each layer of the build and document the parts used in each layer. We will build that into a build plan tagged to the users user account.

We've been having a great time and I'm buying some new ones and browsing lego forums now.

It occurs to me that I have a bunch of the old 'rare' pieces which some people value a lot more than I do. Without having to look up each piece, and sell them on eBay with all that hassle, is there a way I could connect with the right people who would look at pictures of my stash and offer me trades? I'm new to this forum, is that an appropriate thing to do here? It would be worth my time if I could get a greater number of less rare pieces.

My collection is almost entirely 1980s and 1990s ""space"" Legos: the original Space, some Blacktron, Blacktron 2. It's not an enormous collection but I understand some people seek out the old light gray pieces, or the transparent yellow base plates, or the original minifigs. I have all those.

Question about treads,4,6gaw0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/legos/comments/6gaw0g/question_about_treads/,0,1497038698.0,"Hello Everyone,

Do any of you have experience with any lego sets that feature caterpillar tracks that are used in sets like 8294 and 8275?
My question is how smooth these kind of treads move without the use of powerfunctions. Drivetrain is a factor to keep in mind.

The reason why i ask you this is because I'm creating a vehicle in LDD, and i wanted the ability to drive/move it by hand when it's complete. Hopefully you can me.

Thank you in advance, and have fun with your own projects!

my brother is soon having a birthday and he requested a lego set. Now I have no idea what to buy so I came here :)

He is going to be 11. Standard kid more or less. Likes minecraft, Rocket league, rubic cubes and all those youtube videos kids watch nowadays. 

Now my budget is around 300$ and that should include delivery in EU. Croatia more specific.

Any good recommendations please :)

Thank you",top_subreddit,1,2018-05-19 14:58:44

Explanations (& Lego set Suggestions) for Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar's Revenge (SPOILERS Obviously),3,6jz1x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/legos/comments/6jz1x8/explanations_lego_set_suggestions_for_dead_men/,0,1498634896.0,"I think Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar‚Äôs Revenge is pretty awesome! Its definitely one of my top 3 favourites of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies! It had an interesting reveal as well as an intriguing post credits scene‚Ä¶ ‚ò∫ 

Regarding some general thoughts on the movie:

1) The opening bank heist scene is definitely the series‚Äô best opening scene, let alone possibly the best bank heist ever captured on film ‚ò∫ Its unbungalievably epic! I can‚Äôt wait to watch the special features on/hear or read possible commentary on how they made the scene. It would have made an excellent Lego set (let alone playable level), as Lego would be able to replicate the mechanics that they used with the horses able to pull the building through town ‚ò∫ 

Also, as for why Jack was in the bank vault at the beginning, rather than just taking the money and running, Jack went to go and secure the vault and ended up running into the mayor‚Äôs wife and distracting her (and himself) with rum ‚ò∫ well they couldn‚Äôt just take the money and run for lack of being able to store/carry it all; as it is, they ended up losing next to all of the gold while trying to take the entire vault! On that note, while it went along with the movie‚Äôs overall theme of moving on, it was kind of stupid of Jack to just give up his Compass for a bottle of rum when he had the one gold coin that they were able to take from the bank vault. Although, as the bottle of rum only cost a SILVER coin, Jack figured that the Compass would be as equal worth as silver, and that it would be better to save the gold coin for something more valuable (even if it is rum) for later. The Compass wasn‚Äôt really working for him, frequently over the last 10 years leading him into a direction that he either couldn‚Äôt figure out and or would only cause him more problems, without any progress on things such as how to free the Black Pearl and be a successful captain, let alone pirate, so he simply gave it up out of depression and frustration; ‚ÄúPirate‚Äôs Life‚Äù, afterall, moving from one way of doing something to the next. 

The ‚Äúexecution‚Äù scene was also just as unbungalievably epic and intense, and also would have made an excellent Lego set/level (even if altered to make it less violent). Seriously, the guillotine swings like an inch towards Jack‚Äôs head and then nearly lands on top of him! I also loved the sharks. They were thankfully included in a Lego set, and along with the ‚Äúexecution‚Äù scene was unbungalievable in D-Box. They, along with the rest of the movie is one of the best D-Box experiences that I‚Äôve ever had ‚ò∫ The shark scene made me and another guy sitting nearby nearly jump out of our seats! For those who don‚Äôt know what D-Box is, they are motion-enabled seats that move with the movie‚Äôs action and other movements. Despite the higher price, aside from the unbungalievable experience enhancing, they are also reserved seats, as they will not work unless they have already been specifically paid for. They can be seen in either 3D or non-3D, and can also be adjusted to preferred motion levels, including no motion at all ‚ò∫ It‚Äôs definitely worth checking out any movie, that would offer it ‚ò∫ None of these sequences were anymore ‚Äúcartoony‚Äù nor suspending of disbelief anymore than any other action sequence in the series and actually felt pretty believable if not realistic to me. You also have to keep in mind that the guillotine sequence was in slow motion, and like how it was for Jack,  I have personally experienced objects landing mere inches away from someone.  

3) Its not really a retcon of how Jack got his compass. As pointed out by the Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki and IMDB, Jack very well bartered the compass from his captain to Tia Dalma. It still came from Tia Dalma only Jack initially received it from his Captain and how he initially received it is just an untold layer of its story. Jack very well learned about the compass‚Äô unique power through Tia Dalma and therefore discovered that it initially came from her. 

4) When he gave the compass away in the previous movies, Jack was still following his overall intent with it, only giving it to others as a leverage to accomplish his overall goal. He gave the compass to Will so as to lead Beckett to Shipwreck cove to give the Pirates to Beckett and square his debt with Davy Jones. He gave the compass to Elizabeth to help him figure out where the Dead Man's Chest was. Here in Dead Men Tell No Tales he directly betrayed the compass by giving it away and not using it for any kind of overall intent. Its like how the cursed medallions only curse those who directly steal one from the chest, otherwise Will and Elizabeth would have been cursed from having personally held and kept the medallion for so long.

5) I‚Äôm really surprised that people are wondering why Will is angry with Jack. Even though it was to save his life, Jack is the reason why Will is cursed in the first place. Would you not feel the same way? This also explains why Will had started becoming fishy; even though he is an honorable man who would do the job well, not even he can live this kind of life without feeling miserable and frustrated let alone running into problems, which could also be the cause and effect of the Flying Dutchman crew being out of control and a possible danger for Henry. 

Nonetheless, Will still needed a crew, regardless of how aggressive they may be, and again its all part of his overall frustration. Keep in mind too that its not exactly easy to find a crew; after all, who would be willing to be bound to a ship without being able to leave and or having to stay for a great length of time? He didn't really have anyone else that would be willing to be part of the crew. And again, not even someone like Will can keep doing the job forever without running into problems and frustration, despite Elizabeth and Henry being greatly loyal to him. Would you be overall satisfied with only being able to see your loved ones only once every 10 years, despite the visits that Henry made? Even with those visits, Will is not truly able to be with his son, let alone with Elizabeth nor truly live any kind of life that would make him honourable despite who he overall is. He is a truly honourable person because he had a true balance of life, despite not being able to get everything he truly wanted. But when you're stuck pretty much literally only doing one thing for all eternity, without truly doing what you can overall live with, let alone overall truly value, it throws you off and turns you against yourself, NO MATTER who you may be. 

6) Uncle Jack was not pointless in any kind of way. His forewarning encouraged Jack to keep moving forward and to NEVER give up, even when things seem very difficult or next to impossible, when Jack was on the brink of giving up and sinking even further. He was actually more fitting to give that kind of advice rather than Teague (who it was actually supposed to be, but had to be changed due to Keith Richards being unavailable for filming). As Teague already gave that kind of advice in the previous 2 films, it would have been too repetitive and predictable. Uncle Jack brought in a nice and appropriate new perspective, as it is he who gave Jack his name and some of his demeanour as well :) 

7) Regarding how Jack & Gibbs lost their Ship- in-a-Bottle Fleet, they very well traded them off, as they couldn‚Äôt find a way to open them, although why they didn‚Äôt think to go to Barbossa in the first place is beyond me, but then again, they probably figured that if they went to Barbossa he would just take the Pearl, let alone their whole fleet and claim them for himself. And without a ship and much of a crew, they are no match for Barbossa when he has the Queen Anne‚Äôs Revenge, let alone the Sword of Triton on his side. Afterall, Barbossa resumes being the Black Pearl‚Äôs captain and ties Jack up when he restores it. 

8) I do agree that the writers were lazy in explaining how & why Salazar and his crew were cursed; I was waiting the whole movie for them to explain it ever since they first appeared. Although, given that the Devil‚Äôs Triangle is another name for the Bermuda Triangle, they merely added more onto the Bermuda Triangle‚Äôs already mysterious nature.

   As for how Salazar knew about Jack‚Äôs Compass, it is quite possible that he ended up killing more of Jack‚Äôs former Wicked Wench crew members and or someone else who may have had/known about the Compass before who happened to sail into the Devil‚Äôs Triangle. Afterall, as pointed out by several, more than a few have sailed into the Triangle and chances are that they very well may have had some kind of connection to Jack and or the Wicked Wench crew.

9) I disagree with people‚Äôs criticisms about Carina and Henry. I thought that they were just as well introduced and just as well developed as when we were first introduced to Jack, Will, Elizabeth and the rest of the characters in Curse of the Black Pearl, albeit in a more hectic nature. Carina has become my second favourite character of the whole series behind Jack, and I personally like Henry much better than Will, both as a character and as an actor. 

10) I really liked that for the first time in the series they actually showed flashbacks when explaining Salazar‚Äôs backstory. This is one of the reasons why Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my least favourites of the series: there is too much talky backstory explanation, which also throws off the movie‚Äôs overall pacing. Afterall, film is SHOW, don‚Äôt TELL. The use of flashbacks helped me feel more engaged with what was going on. Granted, at times the series did not essentially need flashbacks, such as when Barbossa was explaining what happened to the Black Pearl in On Stranger Tides, (which nonetheless was helped by the use of cannon fire sound effects), but it would have helped some of the lengthy and confusing explanation given in Curse of the Black Pearl and some of Dead Man‚Äôs Chest, especially when they talk about but don‚Äôt really explain certain things such as Cortes, whom I had no idea who he is, which also doesn‚Äôt help with their kind of accents and the way that they talk. 

11) They could have explained her better, but overall I was fine with Shansa. There are obviously more ‚Äúwitchy‚Äù/fortune teller characters in the series, yet I actually thought they were going to bring Tia Dalma/Calypso back when I heard Shansa‚Äôs voice over in a TV spot, and I‚Äôm really glad that they didn‚Äôt. The Calypso stuff is what partly ruined At World‚Äôs End for me; I know that the Heathen Gods cursed the Medallions in Curse of the Black Pearl, but they went a little too far in directly featuring a God, which went against the series‚Äô groundedness and sense of reality. They could have still kept most of the Calypso stuff without directly featuring her, having (most of) the Pirate Lords still believe that Tia Dalma is Calypso, but in reality can only channel Calypso‚Äôs power, and tries to use it to conjure the Maelstrom, only to have herself be over powered and fall to her doom in the process. The movie would have still been overall the same, while also having it be more like the other films, not only in reality, but in overall feeling. 

Out of all of the movies, At World‚Äôs End feels the least like a Pirates movie (which is ironic because it also features the most amount of pirates), largely because of the overuse of Calypso and other spiritual supernatural content. The other 4 movies were able to have their supernatural content feel grounded and believable, but At World‚Äôs End overdid it with things like Calypso and the Multiple Jacks, which felt out of place in the Pirates world. Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio stated on the At World‚Äôs End Extras that they ‚Äújust went weird‚Äù in order to keep it unexpected, but On Stranger Tides (which they also wrote) and Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar‚Äôs Revenge (of which Rossio co-wrote the story), proved (regardless of how you overall feel about them), that they were still able to keep it fresh and grounded, if not unexpected, without having to go against the series‚Äô overall reality. 

12) I actually cried at Barbossa‚Äôs death ‚òπ It was so all of a sudden and quite unexpected, and yet still very beautifully well portrayed. Overall, they gave Barbossa a good send off with him becoming this powerful, rich pirate and achieving everything that he truly wanted, only to discover his true self, including the unexpected revelation that he has a daughter, which brought out his true humanity that we knew he had through other circumstances throughout the series. As well, he did NOT rejoin the navy, no matter what some people may think, despite still wearing the wig and having control of a fleet. Per his introduction in On Stranger Tides, he found the wig comfortable and saw it as a symbol of power and authority, and in having achieved it after all of these years of not being in high power and or having it taken away from him. 

I also cried at the end when Will & Elizabeth were reunited. It was a very beautiful way to give puncture to their story and truly added feeling onto the movie‚Äôs overall goal and overall moral of there ALWAYS being a way to fix ANYTHING, even if it seems pretty much impossible; No matter how impossible things seem, a powerful enough dream will overcome any darkness ‚ò∫ As Poseidon‚Äôs Trident broke EVERY curse in the ocean, Will is completely free from his curse and therefore would have his heart placed back inside his body as he was already living without it albeit in an undead state, like how the Flying Dutchman crew turned back into humans at the end of At World‚Äôs End and also had it stored in the Dead Man‚Äôs Chest that was part of the curse. 

The only other things that I didn‚Äôt really like about the movie were a slight lack of Hans Zimmer‚Äôs original themes, and a weak final battle, which is also the series‚Äô worst final battle. I didn‚Äôt really get any kind of emotional revelation with Jack regaining his status as a favourite captain. I also agree that they should have had Will come in and help them, and I was actually quite certain that was going to happen, but on the other hand, they already did that in At World‚Äôs End and it goes against the overall story and conflict, as it would prove that Will doesn‚Äôt essentially need to be rid of his curse as he and his crew can do so good when cursed, but overall they are their best selves when they are NOT cursed, again harkening back to a reason why Will was starting to become fishy and why the crew was a potential threat to Henry. As well, the Flying Dutchman wouldn't've been able to really do anything as Salazar and his crew were ghosts. The most they would be able to do would be to completely hold them off, which Jack & co. were already pretty much able to do on their own :)

Geoff Zanelli did an overall great job with the music and did use a lot of the original themes, more so than in movies like the later Harry Potters and The Marvel Cinematic Universe, but he could have used more original themes such as ‚ÄúSkull and Crossbones‚Äù and or ‚ÄúTo the Pirates‚Äô Cave!‚Äù in places like the final battle which would have had it be better and more engaging. Overall, Geoff Zanelli was a perfect replacement with his new themes (especially that new rousing adventure theme that plays at 4:20 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_PNnNkBY74&index=9&list=PLow_t-BoGfWdYYmeel8Log7-zY6JQJsOm ) which actually fit perfectly well into the Pirates world and not have it seem like a generic action adventure movie. 

There is also the following that needs to be resolved:

Where are Pintel & Ragetti and Cotton? It is possible that like possibly Marty, Mullroy & Murtogg they were in Tortuga after Blackbeard attacked the Black Pearl, only to rejoin Jack & or Barbossa, but they should have at least provided an explanation as to where they were/are, especially since Cotton‚Äôs Parrot was shown flying around the Black Pearl in On Stranger Tides, yet is nowhere to be seen in Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar‚Äôs Revenge when the Pearl is restored (although it may be possible that he was resting inside the Pearl) They approached Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg to reprise their roles, but both turned it down, only to regret it afterwards.      
        
What happened to Phillip and Syrena, although their story pretty much seems to be resolved on its own with it being shown that Syrena took Phillip to be healed and they lived happily ever after in some form or another.

On Stranger Tides‚Äô post credits scene, however there may be a deleted scene, as featured in Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar‚Äôs Revenge‚Äôs novel that somewhat resolves it: Jack‚Äôs sword becomes cursed (potentially from his Vodoo Doll) and starts going against him, only to eventually over come it.  

And of course, Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar‚Äôs Revenge‚Äôs own post credits scene. They cannot leave the film series as it is, especially without resolving this post credits scene. Its too much of a set up to be overlooked, even more so than On Stranger Tides‚Äô, and not resolving it has the series feel incomplete and no series, let alone something as overall beloved and successful as Pirates should be overall incomplete. 

Please keep in mind as well that some of these problems with the movie can be fixed/better explained with possible deleted scenes. The movie was originally reported as being 153 minutes, yet only ended up only being 129, so theres possibly about 23 minutes worth of deleted scenes that may help the movie if released :) Ôªø",top_subreddit,1,2017-06-28 02:28:16

What age (average) would a child outgrow the larger-sized bricks?  Sorry to sound so dense -- I never played with Legos as a kid, so I'm really in the dark here.  My quandary is that I have a family with 4 children whom I'd like to give one of the batches of legos to (ages infant, 3, 4 and 5), and I'm guessing that they should probably get the larger-sized bricks/base plates.  That leaves me with the smaller set (several large bags of loose bricks and shapes in assorted colors).  Would those be inappropriate for a 2-1/2 year old child?

After they fire, they are covered in smoke and soot residue. To make matters worse, when the restoration people came to pack the house up and take everything to be cleaned they just threw the sets into boxes. (They didn't take them to be cleaned because they were written off as a loss and we were given money for them.) So now I am left with a tangled mess of half assembled Lego sets covered in snake residue. My question is what is everyone's thoughts on the best way to clean and reassemble them? (Because some of these sets can no long be purchased because of discontinuation...i.e.  Space Shuttle, Original Pirate ship, and the Falcon) My current plan is to completely dissemble everything soak the pieces without stickers in water and just wipe the ones with stickers off.

If you're interested, please fill out our short application survey:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RfpGvE7ExUOvAvVwcROKck1oF15bEv6Qn35PjkDaPec/viewform?usp=send_form
The custom chip is a 96Mhz ARM¬Æ Cortex¬Æ-M4 processor with full Arduino compatibility. Our custom PCB includes a barometer, a magnetometer, several indicator LEDs, ADC converters, and support for Wi-Fi and GPS. It‚Äôs a close clone of the Teensy 3.2 board.  This kit is more than just a pile of LEGO some motors and props.

Have to say though, those were tough to do. Didn't help that the shuttle didn't have labelled bags like the B-Wing did for specific assembled pieces that you could just fit together. I enjoyed it though, and hopefully my next set isn't missing any",top_subreddit,1,2016-01-17 17:57:29

I inherited (or rather my 4y.o. did) lots of DUPLO tracks and misc., most likely coming from 9125 Intelligent Train Set, 10052, extra locomotive and 3774 Bridge. Might have been others expansion packs as there is quite a lot of the Intelli control plates for tracks. 

The problem is that the 2 locomotives are worse for wear. One struggles to even move, other goes okayish solo, but nopes at climbing bridge or pulling cargo. Is there any known problem, like hair on the axles, or repairable coupling, that can be fixed?

Anyone have any pointers on where to look or maybe better ideas on how to display them.

Top Ten Lego Themes,1,78fca6,https://www.reddit.com/r/legos/comments/78fca6/top_ten_lego_themes/,0,1508847499.0,"10-Lego Marvel-This lands at the number ten for good set play features,the one thing that is putting it in the tenth spot is the big prices for sets. For example a set that has a little more pieces than a 5 pound lego city set is 10-13 pounds.
9-Lego dimensions-Although this is not really a theme but a game its still one of the best lego thing showing us sets we would never see otherwise.
8-Lego Ideas-This is a very cool Idea to let lego builders make sets of their own,the pieces are special. Sadly these sell out very quickly so i couldn't get my hands on any of these.
7-Lego Creator-These make house design very interesting with its unreal looks.
6-Lego Space Classic-These sets although never owned by me were special with all the amazing sets and pieces like the moon themed base plates.
5-Lego City-These are sometimes cheap and sometimes very nice sets on display thats why i like them.
4-Lego Ninjago-NINJA GO! NINJA GO! Oh sorry i got carried away with the cool ninja,swords and all the mechs and buildings and figures which are so special that they diserve more sets.
3-Lego Star Wars-I like these sets only because i love star wars yea yea call me a nerd i don't care i love these for how good they explore the scene in the movies.
2-Power Miners-I Love these sets.I have three main reasons for loving them as much as i do. First of all the figures of the rock monsters are a ver cool looking.Second of all the builds are refreshing and new.Lastly the pieces in the sets are cool for mocs.
1-Lego Hero Factory-Even though people say its a bionicle copy but they are very cool looking although it is never be coming back it will have its legacy.",top_subreddit,1,2017-10-24 07:18:19

Curious if this exists or not... I just started building again, and I was thinking about how great it would be if there was a dynamic b-model site.

Here's the premise:

You enter in the model/set # that you own (one set, or multiple sets) and the site comes up with a list of pdf build instructions. (Lets say you own 4 sets, it would show all the different builds you could make with those pieces). Only own two? It would show the builds for those two, but also additional builds if you bought an additional one or two sets. This would not only reinforce your existing lego purchases, but also help support and grow additional lego set purchases.
