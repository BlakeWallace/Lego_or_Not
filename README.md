Classifying Lego Sub-Reddits

---

### Objective

Construct and compare two classification models that attempt to predict whether a single random reddit post is from a subreddit associated with lego.

---

### Data

13,212 reddit posts are used to train our models.  This included 6,566 from three different lego subreddits, along with 6646 from three different non-lego subreddits.

---

### Results

Even though the first constructed models using a Random Forest classification varied significantly when tested on new data, the final results using unseen data on a Naive Bayes model tested quite closely to the initial training data.
